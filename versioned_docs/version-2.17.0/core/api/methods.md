# Methods

Methods are used to execute actions and request data back from the API.

## Access

Each method below identifies which clients may call it:

- **Unauthenticated bootstrap:** JSON-RPC methods `settings.auth.claim`, `settings.auth.status`, `settings.auth.link`, and redacted `settings.auth.link.status` are available before authentication. Remote HTTP POST requires `allowed_ips` and remains rate limited. Separate client-pairing endpoints `/api/pair/start` and `/api/pair/finish` are remotely reachable and strictly rate limited. `/health` is unrestricted and returns only `OK`.
- **All accepted clients:** localhost, authenticated admin, authenticated member, and legacy clients admitted by platform compatibility policy.
- **Localhost or any authenticated client:** localhost, paired clients, and API-key admin. Legacy clients are rejected.
- **`profiles.manage`:** localhost and clients with the capability. Admin has it; member does not. Legacy retains it only on approved appliance platforms.
- **`settings.write`:** localhost and clients with the capability. Admin has it; member does not. Legacy retains it only on approved appliance platforms.
- **`input`:** localhost, member, and admin. Legacy input is grandfathered only on MiSTer, MiSTeX, Batocera, and ReplayOS.
- **`screenshot`:** localhost, member, and admin. Legacy screenshot capture is grandfathered only on MiSTer and ReplayOS.
- **`update.apply`:** localhost and authenticated admin. Member and legacy do not receive it.
- **Localhost or admin:** localhost, paired admin, and API-key admin. Member and legacy are rejected.
- **Localhost only:** requests originating from Core's device. All remote clients are rejected.

Use [`clients.current`](#clientscurrent) to inspect current connection's access state, paired role, and effective capabilities. A method may also require a resource-specific credential, such as a profile PIN; those requirements are documented separately from connection access.

## Launching

### run

**Access:** All clients.

Emulate the scanning of a token. Access is decided when the API accepts `run`; mapped and expanded ZapScript commands do not re-evaluate connection capabilities during internal execution. Legacy `run` access therefore remains limited to explicitly grandfathered platforms.

#### Parameters

Accepts two types of parameters:

- A string, in which case the string will be treated as the token text with all other options set as default.
- An object:

| Key    | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                    |
| :----- | :------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type   | string  | No       | An internal category of the type of token being scanned. _Not currently in use outside of logging._            |
| uid    | string  | No\*     | The UID of the token being scanned. For example, the UID of an NFC tag. Used for matching mappings.            |
| text   | string  | No\*     | The main text to be processed from a scan, should contain [ZapScript](../../zapscript/index.md).               |
| data   | string  | No\*     | The raw data read from a token, converted to a hexadecimal string. Used in mappings and detection of NFC toys. |
| unsafe | boolean | No       | Allow unsafe operations. Default is false.                                                                     |

These parameters allow emulating a token exactly as it would be read directly from an attached reader on the server. A request's parameters must contain at least a populated `uid`, `text` or `data` value.

#### Result

Returns `null` once the ZapScript has finished executing without error. The method waits for execution to complete: mapping, parsing, launch policy (profiles, playtime limits, blocked commands, hooks), media lookup and every command in the script. Success means the script ran to completion; it does not prove the launched software is still running afterwards.

If execution fails, the response carries an [error](index.md#response-errors) whose `data.category` is one of:

| Category           | Meaning                                                                                       |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `busy`             | Another launch is already in progress.                                                        |
| `media_not_found`  | The requested media could not be found or matched.                                            |
| `disabled`         | ZapScript execution is disabled in settings.                                                  |
| `invalid_script`   | The script could not be parsed, or names an unknown command or system.                        |
| `blocked`          | Execution was refused by configuration, a profile requirement or a hook.                      |
| `playtime_limit`   | A playtime limit prevented the launch.                                                        |
| `timeout`          | Core stopped waiting after the request timeout (30 seconds). Anything already started continues. |
| `cancelled`        | The request was cancelled, for example because the connection closed. Anything already started continues. |
| `unavailable`      | The service is shutting down.                                                                 |
| `execution_failed` | Any other execution failure.                                                                  |

Error messages are fixed per category and never include filesystem paths or token contents; the details are in the Core log. `timeout` and `cancelled` only mean Core stopped waiting: nothing that already started is rolled back. During shutdown the connection often closes before the `unavailable` response can be written, so treat a dropped connection with a request in flight the same way.

Physical reader scans, playlists and the [launch endpoint](index.md#launch-endpoint) are not affected. They remain asynchronous and do not report execution failures.

For ZapScript `launch.random`, Core selects uniformly from matching non-missing media rows after applying systems, tags, and path scope. Filesystem and virtual path targets recursively include subfolders. Tagged requests never use filesystem fallback because unindexed files have no tag metadata.

##### Compatibility

Earlier Core versions returned `null` as soon as the token was accepted, before execution started, and never reported execution failures. Clients that treated an immediate `null` as "launched" should now expect the response to arrive when execution finishes, or when Core stops waiting for it. A `timeout` or `cancelled` error means Core stopped waiting, not that execution ended: work already started continues, so poll for the effect rather than treating either as proof of failure. Any other error response is authoritative.

##### Aliases

`launch` is a deprecated alias for `run` with identical parameters and result. `run.script` is reserved and currently returns a method-not-found error.

#### Example

##### Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "52f6242e-7a5a-11ef-bf93-020304050607",
  "method": "run",
  "params": {
    "text": "**launch.system:snes"
  }
}
```

##### Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "52f6242e-7a5a-11ef-bf93-020304050607",
  "result": null
}
```

##### Error response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "52f6242e-7a5a-11ef-bf93-020304050607",
  "error": {
    "code": 1,
    "message": "media not found",
    "data": {
      "category": "media_not_found"
    }
  }
}
```

### stop

**Access:** All clients.

Kill any active launcher, if possible.

This method is highly dependant on the platform and specific launcher used. It's not guaranteed that a launcher is capable of killing the playing process.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

Returns `null` on success.

Currently, it is not reported if a process was killed or not.

#### Example

##### Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "176b4558-7a5b-11ef-b318-020304050607",
  "method": "stop"
}
```

##### Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "176b4558-7a5b-11ef-b318-020304050607",
  "result": null
}
```

### confirm

**Access:** All clients.

Confirm and launch a staged token from the launch guard.

When launch guard is enabled and media is playing, scanned tokens are staged instead of launched immediately. This method confirms the currently staged token and launches it.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

Returns `null` on success. Returns an error if no token is currently staged.

#### Example

##### Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-7a5b-11ef-b318-020304050607",
  "method": "confirm"
}
```

##### Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-7a5b-11ef-b318-020304050607",
  "result": null
}
```

## UI

Core exposes transient UI requests so connected clients—and host platform when appropriate—can render same notice, loader, picker, or confirmation in parallel. Core initially keeps at most one active request, but API uses arrays for future expansion. First valid response for event ID wins; stale responses fail.

UI events are intended for small, non-sensitive interactions. They are broadcast to every permitted connected client. Never use them for PINs, passwords, recovery codes, or other secrets.

### ui

**Access:** All clients.

Returns authoritative UI event state. Clients should call this after connecting or reconnecting.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

| Key      | Type                 | Required | Description |
| :------- | :------------------- | :------- | :---------- |
| revision | number               | Yes      | Monotonic revision of global UI state shared across clients. Ignore older snapshots. |
| events   | [UI event](#ui-event-object)[] | Yes | Active events. Initial implementation contains zero or one event. |
| resolved | [UI resolution](#ui-resolution-object)[] | Yes | Always empty in query response; terminal resolutions are delivered by `ui.changed`. |

##### UI event object

| Key             | Type      | Required | Description |
| :-------------- | :-------- | :------- | :---------- |
| id              | string    | Yes      | Opaque event ID required by `ui.respond`. |
| kind            | string    | Yes      | `notice`, `loader`, `picker`, or `confirm`. |
| title           | string    | No       | Optional heading. |
| message         | string    | No       | Optional body text. |
| choices         | object[]  | No       | Picker choices containing opaque `id` and display `label`. |
| selectedChoiceId | string   | No       | Initially selected picker choice. |
| dismissible     | boolean   | Yes      | Whether `dismiss` is accepted. |
| createdAt       | string    | Yes      | RFC3339 creation timestamp. |
| expiresAt       | string    | No       | Authoritative RFC3339 expiry. Omitted for producer-controlled events such as loaders. |

Choice IDs are presentation-safe. Executable ZapScript and private choice values remain inside Core.

#### Example

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "ui-state-1",
  "method": "ui"
}
```

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "ui-state-1",
  "result": {
    "revision": 8,
    "events": [
      {
        "id": "56969e9c-f863-4cc8-9c2c-d7512bf10d4d",
        "kind": "confirm",
        "title": "Change game?",
        "message": "**launch.system:snes",
        "dismissible": true,
        "createdAt": "2026-07-16T12:00:00Z",
        "expiresAt": "2026-07-16T12:00:15Z"
      }
    ],
    "resolved": []
  }
}
```

### ui.respond

**Access:** All clients.

Responds to active UI event. First valid response wins globally and closes host/client renderers.

#### Parameters

| Key      | Type   | Required | Description |
| :------- | :----- | :------- | :---------- |
| id       | string | Yes      | Active event ID. |
| action   | string | Yes      | `dismiss`, `select`, or `confirm`. |
| choiceId | string | No       | Required for picker `select`; must identify one published choice. |

Allowed actions:

- `notice`: `dismiss` when dismissible
- `loader`: `dismiss` only when explicitly dismissible
- `picker`: `select` with `choiceId`, or `dismiss`
- `confirm`: `confirm`, or `dismiss` when dismissible

Returns `null` when accepted. Returns client error for stale event ID, invalid action, missing/unknown choice, expired event, or non-dismissible event.

#### Example

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "ui-response-1",
  "method": "ui.respond",
  "params": {
    "id": "56969e9c-f863-4cc8-9c2c-d7512bf10d4d",
    "action": "confirm"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "ui-response-1",
  "result": null
}
```

Top-level `confirm` remains launch-guard-specific for compatibility. It cannot confirm unrelated generic UI event.

##### UI resolution object

| Key     | Type   | Required | Description |
| :------ | :----- | :------- | :---------- |
| id      | string | Yes      | Resolved event ID. |

### media.search

**Access:** All clients.

Query the media database and return all matching indexed media.

**Note:** This API uses cursor-based pagination for all requests. The `total` field is deprecated and returns only the current response-page count; it is not the full match count. Use the `pagination` object to navigate through results. For subsequent pages, include the `nextCursor` value and repeat the same systems, pathPrefix, query, tags, letter, and sort scope.

#### Parameters

An object:

| Key        | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                                                    |
| :--------- | :------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| query      | string   | No       | Case-insensitive search by filename. By default, query is split by white space and results are found which contain every word. If omitted, all media is returned. |
| systems    | string[] | No       | Case-sensitive list of system IDs to restrict search to. A missing key or empty list will search all systems.                  |
| pathPrefix | string   | No       | Recursively restrict results beneath a filesystem directory or virtual route. Matching respects path boundaries, so `/roms/SNES` does not include `/roms/SNES2`; `%` and `_` are literal path characters. |
| maxResults | number   | No       | Max number of results to return. Default is 100.                                                                               |
| cursor     | string   | No       | Cursor for pagination. Omit for first page, use `nextCursor` from previous response for subsequent pages with the same scope and sort. |
| tags       | string[] | No       | Filter results by case-sensitive tags. Maximum 50 tags, each up to 128 characters. Default and `+` filters require matches, `-` excludes matches, and `~` joins alternatives. Can be used without query or systems for tag-only searches. |
| letter     | string   | No       | Filter results by first character of game name. Supports: A-Z (single letters), "0-9" (numbers), "#" (symbols). Case-insensitive. |
| sort       | string   | No       | Explicit order: `name-asc`, `name-desc`, `filename-asc`, or `filename-desc`. Name uses the returned display name with SQLite's case-insensitive collation; filename uses full indexed path. Omitted preserves legacy database order. |
| fuzzySystem | boolean | No       | Enable fuzzy matching for system IDs in the `systems` array (e.g., `"snes"` matches `"SNES"`). |

#### Result

| Key        | Type                               | Required | Description                                                                     |

### media.browse

**Access:** All clients.

Browse indexed media content by directory, similar to navigating a file manager. Supports filesystem paths, virtual URI schemes (e.g. `mame-arcade://`), and paginated results.

When called without a `path` parameter (or with an empty path), returns top-level root entries including filesystem roots and virtual scheme roots. When `systems` is provided without `path`, returns populated launcher routes for those systems only. Pass the same `systems` filter when browsing a returned route to keep shared paths scoped to the selected systems.

Set `rootView` to `contents` with exactly one system to replace its filesystem routes with a one-level view of their immediate contents. This is display-only: entries retain physical paths, and browsing a returned directory uses ordinary single-path behavior. Root priority follows platform order (first root wins); exact, case-sensitive filesystem basenames define collisions. Virtual URI routes remain separate.

A directory whose direct contents collapse to a single logical launch target is returned with that target's `mediaId`, display name, `zapScript`, `tags`, and `hasCover`, so a per-game disc folder appears as one launchable game. A directory qualifies when it holds one media file, one `.m3u` plus its discs, or one `.cue` plus its companion tracks, and holds no media in subdirectories. Its `type` stays `directory` and it keeps its own `path` and `fileCount`, so clients can still navigate into it. Directories that hold nested media or an ambiguous file set stay plain directories.

Tags filter direct media files in the current path. Directories remain visible for navigation with unfiltered `fileCount` values, while `totalFiles`, file pagination, and cursors reflect only matching files. Tagged directory entries remain plain directories rather than being promoted to logical single-game aliases.

#### Parameters

All parameters are optional. When called with no parameters, returns root entries.

| Key        | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                |
| :--------- | :----- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| path       | string | No       | Directory path to browse. Omit or set empty to list root entries. Supports filesystem paths and virtual URI schemes (e.g. `mame-arcade://`). |
| systems    | string[] | No     | Case-sensitive list of system IDs to restrict route discovery and browse results to. A missing key or empty list preserves unfiltered behavior. |
| fuzzySystem | boolean | No     | Enable fuzzy matching for system IDs in the `systems` array (e.g., `"snes"` matches `"SNES"`). |
| rootView   | string | No       | Pathless system-root presentation: `routes` (default) returns separate populated routes; `contents` returns one-level immediate contents and requires exactly one system. Ignored when `path` is non-empty. Repeat with cursor requests. |
| maxResults | number | No       | Maximum results per page. Default is 100, maximum is 1000.                                                 |
| cursor     | string | No       | Opaque pagination cursor from a previous response's `nextCursor`. Omit for first page. Cursors are valid only with the same path, systems, tags, letter, and sort parameters. |
| tags       | string[] | No     | Filter direct media files by tags. Syntax and AND/NOT/OR operators match `media.search`. Directories remain unfiltered. |
| letter     | string | No       | Filter results to entries starting with this letter.                                                       |
| sort       | string | No       | Sort order. One of: `name-asc` (default), `name-desc`, `filename-asc`, `filename-desc`. Name sorting is prefix-aware for detected ranked/date collection folders. The `filename` variants sort by full file path. |

#### Result

#### Root contents example

With SNES media under `/configured/SNES` and `/roms/SNES`, this view displays their immediate children together. If both roots contain the same basename, `/configured/SNES` wins because it appears first in platform root order.

```

Selecting `RPGs` browses only `/configured/SNES/RPGs`; `rootView` does not merge lower levels.

### media.browse.index

**Access:** All clients.

Return the ordered first-character "jump to letter" buckets for a browse scope. Each bucket carries a count and a ready-to-use cursor that seeks `media.browse` to the start of that bucket, so a single round trip gives a client everything it needs to draw a section rail _and_ jump into the full ordered list. This avoids paging from the top to reach a distant section, which matters on constrained clients (e.g. MiSTer).

The scope parameters mirror `media.browse` so the index describes the exact media-file list `media.browse` would return for the same scope. The per-bucket `cursor` is an ordinary browse cursor: pass it to `media.browse` with the same `path`/`systems`/`tags`/`sort` to get a normal page that begins at the bucket and continues into the next bucket as the user scrolls.

#### Parameters

All parameters are optional.

| Key         | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                       |
| :---------- | :------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| path        | string   | No       | Directory or virtual scheme to index, same as `media.browse`. Omit or set empty for a root listing (no rail applies). |
| systems     | string[] | No       | Case-sensitive system IDs to scope the index to, same as `media.browse`.                          |
| fuzzySystem | boolean  | No       | Enable fuzzy matching for system IDs in `systems`.                                                |
| tags        | string[] | No       | Filter indexed media by tags, using the same syntax and operators as `media.browse`.               |
| sort        | string   | No       | Sort order, must match the `media.browse` sort the rail is for. One of `name-asc` (default), `name-desc`, `filename-asc`, `filename-desc`. |

#### Result

| Key        | Type                                          | Required | Description                                                                 |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| scheme     | string                                        | Yes      | Collation used to derive the buckets. `latin` for first-character bucketing; `none` when no rail applies (a root listing, or a directory whose effective sort is not alphabetical, e.g. a ranked/date-prefixed collection folder), in which case `groups` is empty. |
| totalFiles | number                                        | Yes      | Total media files matching the complete systems/path/tags scope.             |
| groups     | [BrowseIndexGroup](#browse-index-group-object)[] | Yes   | Only non-empty buckets, ordered to match `sort`.                            |

##### Browse index group object

| Key    | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                       |
| :----- | :----- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| key    | string | Yes      | Stable bucket identifier (`A`–`Z`, `0-9`, `#`). Treat as opaque.                                  |
| label  | string | Yes      | Display text for the bucket. Equal to `key` for the `latin` scheme.                               |
| count  | number | Yes      | Number of media files in the bucket.                                                              |
| cursor | string | Yes      | Opaque `media.browse` cursor positioned just before the bucket's first row. Empty string for the bucket that begins the list (call `media.browse` with no cursor for the first page). |
| offset | number | Yes      | 0-based position of the bucket's first item among the scope's media files, taken from its row number in the same ordered listing `media.browse` pages through (so it cannot drift from the browse order). Excludes any directory entries the listing shows before files; a client that jumps to a position in the full list adds its own leading-directory count. Use this to jump to the bucket's position rather than reloading from `cursor`. |

Clients should render `groups` exactly as received, in order, without assuming a particular alphabet: `scheme` and `key` are opaque so a future locale-aware scheme (e.g. pinyin/kana/hangul buckets) requires no client change.

#### Example

##### Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "media.browse.index",
  "params": {
    "path": "/roms/SNES",
    "sort": "name-asc"
  }
}
```

##### Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "scheme": "latin",
    "totalFiles": 150,
    "groups": [
      { "key": "#", "label": "#", "count": 3, "cursor": "", "offset": 0 },
      { "key": "0-9", "label": "0-9", "count": 7, "cursor": "eyJzb3J0VmFsdWUiOiIjV29sZiIsImxhc3RJZCI6MTAyfQ==", "offset": 3 },
      { "key": "A", "label": "A", "count": 12, "cursor": "eyJzb3J0VmFsdWUiOiI5IExpdmVzIiwibGFzdElkIjoxMTV9", "offset": 10 }
    ]
  }
}
```

To jump to "A", the client calls `media.browse` with that group's `cursor` and the same `path`/`sort`; the returned page begins at the first "A" title and continues into "B" as the user keeps scrolling.

### media.tags

**Access:** All clients.

Query the media database and return available tags for filtering.

This method returns all available tags (with their types) for the specified systems. Use this to build dynamic filter UIs showing available tag options.

#### Parameters

| Key     | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                         |
| :------ | :------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| systems     | string[] | No       | Case-sensitive list of system IDs to restrict tags to. A missing key or empty list will get all systems. |
| fuzzySystem | boolean  | No       | Enable fuzzy matching for system IDs in the `systems` array (e.g., `"snes"` matches `"SNES"`). |

#### Result

| Key  | Type                     | Required | Description                    |
| :--- | :----------------------- | :------- | :----------------------------- |
| tags | [TagInfo](#taginfo-object)[] | Yes      | Array of available tags.       |

**Tag Capping:** To prevent large responses, long-tail tag types are capped at 100 entries
per type. Tags within each type are sorted by usage count (most popular first), then
alphabetically. The following types are capped: `credit`, `developer`, `mameparent`,
`publisher`, `search`. Taxonomy types (e.g., `region`, `year`, `lang`, `gamegenre`, `gamefamily`)
have finite vocabularies per system and are always returned in full without truncation.

##### TagInfo object

| Key  | Type   | Required | Description                           |
| :--- | :----- | :------- | :------------------------------------ |
| tag  | string | Yes      | The tag value.                        |
| type | string | Yes      | The tag type (e.g., "genre", "year"). |

#### Example

##### Request

  "params": {
    "systems": ["NES", "SNES"]
  }
}
```

##### Response

        "tag": "action"
      },
      {
        "type": "genre",
        "tag": "platformer"
      },
      {
        "type": "gamefamily",
        "tag": "Mario Bros"
      },
      {
        "type": "gamefamily",
        "tag": "Super Mario"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### media.tags.update

**Access:** All clients.

Add or remove user tags for an indexed media item.

The initial mutable tag is `user:favorite`. It appears in normal media tag results and can be queried with `media.search` tag filters such as `user:favorite`, `-user:favorite`, and `~user:favorite`.

#### Parameters

| Key     | Type     | Required | Description                                               |
| :------ | :------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| mediaId | number   | No       | Media DBID to update. Cannot be mixed with system/path.   |
| system  | string   | No       | System ID for path-based lookup. Required when using path. |
| path    | string   | No       | Media path for path-based lookup. Required with system.    |
| add     | string[] | No       | Tags to add. Currently only `user:favorite` is mutable.    |
| remove  | string[] | No       | Tags to remove. Currently only `user:favorite` is mutable. |

Either `mediaId` or `system` plus `path` is required. At least one of `add` or `remove` is required. Search operators (`+`, `-`, `~`) are not valid in mutation requests.

#### Result

| Key  | Type                         | Required | Description                          |
| :--- | :--------------------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------- |
| tags | [TagInfo](#taginfo-object)[] | Yes      | Effective tags for the media item.   |

#### Example

##### Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-7a5d-11ef-9c7b-020304050607",
  "method": "media.tags.update",
  "params": {
    "mediaId": 42,
    "add": ["user:favorite"]
  }
}
```

##### Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-7a5d-11ef-9c7b-020304050607",
  "result": {
    "tags": [
      {
        "type": "user",
        "tag": "favorite"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### media.generate

**Access:** All clients.

Create a new media database index.

During indexing, the server will emit [media.indexing](./notifications.md) notifications showing progress of the index.

#### Parameters

Optionally, an object:

| Key     | Type     | Required | Description                                                                         |
| :------ | :------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| systems     | string[] | No       | List of system IDs to restrict indexing to. Other system indexes will remain as is. |
| fuzzySystem | boolean  | No       | Enable fuzzy matching for system IDs in the `systems` array (e.g., `"snes"` matches `"SNES"`). |
| rebuild     | boolean  | No       | Discard the media database entirely and index from scratch ("fresh start"). Scraped metadata is lost and must be re-scraped; favourites and launcher overrides are preserved (they live in the user database and are re-applied after indexing). Cannot be combined with `systems`. |

An omitted or `null` value parameters key is also valid and will index every system.

**Selective Indexing Behavior:**
- When `systems` is provided with specific system IDs, only those systems will be reindexed
- The server will validate all provided system IDs and return an error if any are invalid
- If all systems are specified (equivalent to no restriction), a full database rebuild will be performed for optimal performance
- Selective indexing cannot be performed while database optimization is running
- Resume functionality will validate that the system configuration hasn't changed between indexing sessions

#### Result

Returns `null` on success. Indexing runs in the background after the response is sent. Track progress using [media.indexing](./notifications.md) notifications.

#### Examples

### media.history.latest

**Access:** All clients.

### media.meta

**Access:** All clients.

Return the full metadata graph for one indexed media row, including its title, system, tags, and scraped properties.

Use this when a client has a search, browse, or lookup result and needs all metadata attached to that row. Identify media by the result's `mediaId` when available, or by `system.id` and canonical `path`. Launcher-relative paths in the `system/path` shape are accepted as a compatibility fallback when they resolve to exactly one indexed media row. Properties are separated by scope: `media.properties` applies to the specific ROM/file row, and `media.title.properties` applies to the shared title.

#### Parameters

An object:

| Key    | Type   | Required | Description                         |
| :----- | :----- | :------- | :---------------------------------- |
| mediaId | number | No      | Opaque media database row ID from search, browse, or lookup. Cannot be mixed with `system`/`path`. |
| system | string | No       | System ID for the media row. Required when `mediaId` is omitted. |
| path   | string | No       | Canonical indexed media path. Required when `mediaId` is omitted. |
| items  | object[] | No     | Batch request items. Each item uses either `mediaId` or `system`/`path`. Maximum 100 items. Cannot be mixed with top-level media ref fields. |

Single requests return the existing single `media` response shape. Batch requests return `{ "items": [...] }` in input order. Each batch item contains either `media` or `error`, so one missing media row does not fail the whole batch.

#### Result

| Key   | Type                                  | Required | Description                  |

Binary property data is not returned by `media.meta`. Use `media.image` to fetch image bytes.
Property keys are canonical type tags such as `property:description`, `property:image-image`, or `property:manual`.

### media.meta.update

**Access:** All clients.

Update writable metadata fields for one indexed media row, then return the same response shape as [`media.meta`](#mediameta).

Use this to store a per-media launcher override. Core validates the launcher exists and supports the media row's system before saving it. Set `launcherOverride` to `null` to clear the override.

Launcher selection order is:

1. Explicit `launcher` advanced argument in ZapScript.
2. Per-media `launcherOverride` stored with `media.meta.update`.
3. System default launcher from configuration.
4. Normal launcher matching.

#### Parameters

An object identifying the media row by `mediaId` or by `system` and canonical `path`.

| Key     | Type   | Required | Description |
| :------ | :----- | :------- | :---------- |
| mediaId | number | No       | Opaque media database row ID from search, browse, or lookup. Cannot be mixed with `system`/`path`. |
| system  | string | No       | System ID for the media row. Required when `mediaId` is omitted. |
| path    | string | No       | Canonical indexed media path. Required when `mediaId` is omitted. |
| media   | object | Yes      | Patch object. Currently supports only `launcherOverride`. |

##### Media patch object

| Key              | Type        | Required | Description |
| :--------------- | :---------- | :------- | :---------- |
| launcherOverride | string\|null | Yes      | Launcher ID to use for this media row, matched case-insensitively and stored with canonical casing. Use `null` to clear it. Empty strings are rejected. |

#### Result

| Key   | Type                            | Required | Description                 |
| :---- | :------------------------------ | :------- | :-------------------------- |
| media | [MediaMeta](#media-meta-object) | Yes      | Updated metadata for row.   |

#### Example

  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "media.meta.update",
  "params": {
    "mediaId": 42,
    "media": {
      "launcherOverride": "RetroArch"
    }

    "media": {
      "launcherOverride": null
    }
  }
}
```

### media.image

**Access:** All clients.

Return the best matching image for one indexed media row. Inline base64 delivery remains default. Clients can explicitly request a transient path to a Core-owned cached thumbnail.

`media.image` checks the requested image types in order. For each type it tries media-level properties first, then title-level properties. If a stored file path no longer exists, the stale property is removed and lookup continues.

#### Parameters

An object identifying the media row by `mediaId` or `(system, path)`. Canonical indexed paths are preferred. Launcher-relative paths in the `system/path` shape are accepted as a compatibility fallback when they resolve to exactly one indexed media row.

| Key        | Type     | Required | Description                                                                 |
| :--------- | :------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mediaId    | number   | No       | Opaque media database row ID from search, browse, or lookup. Cannot be mixed with `system`/`path`. |
| system     | string   | No       | System ID. Required when `mediaId` is omitted.                              |
| path       | string   | No       | Canonical indexed media path. Required when `mediaId` is omitted.            |
| imageTypes | string[] | No       | Image type preference order. Defaults to `image`, `thumbnail`, `boxart`, `boxart3d`, `screenshot`, `wheel`, `titleshot`, `map`, `marquee`, `fanart`. |
| maxSize    | number   | No       | Longest-edge size hint in pixels. When set, the server resizes the image to fit a `maxSize`×`maxSize` box and caches the result; omit it for the full-size image. Required for `localPath` delivery. |
| delivery   | string   | No       | `inline` (default) or `localPath`. `localPath` requires a positive `maxSize` and returns a path on the Core host. |

Supported image type values are `image`, `thumbnail`, `boxart`, `boxart3d`, `screenshot`, `wheel`, `titleshot`, `map`, `marquee`, and `fanart`. They resolve to canonical property tags such as `property:image-image` and `property:image-boxart`.

Resizing is intended for grid and preview views where transferring and holding full-size art is expensive. `maxSize` is snapped up to the nearest of a small set of standard tiers (`32`, `64`, `128`, `256`, `512`, `768`) server-side. The returned image is **never larger than the snapped tier and never larger than the source** — when the source already fits the tier it is returned at its native dimensions, so the result may still be larger than the exact `maxSize` you asked for. Request your true display size (logical size × pixel ratio) and downscale to the final size on the client. The snapped tiers bound how many resized variants are cached per image. Output is re-encoded as WebP (lossy, alpha preserved) regardless of source format — including when the source already fits the box, so even a near-native request still gets the smaller WebP — and cached on disk so repeat requests are cheap. The original bytes are kept only when WebP would not shrink them (already-compact sources), when `maxSize` is omitted/non-positive (full size), or when the source cannot be decoded.

`localPath` never returns an original scraper or media path. Core resolves image semantics, materializes its own bounded thumbnail cache artifact, and returns that path. Path delivery is available to any client that explicitly requests it, regardless of peer locality or Core platform; remote callers are responsible for having an appropriate shared-filesystem view of the Core host path. Treat the path as opaque, transient, and nonportable: read it immediately, never persist it or derive neighboring paths, and retry once with `delivery: "inline"` if the file is inaccessible or disappears before it is opened. If cache materialization fails, Core can safely return `delivery: "inline"` in the same response.

#### Result

| Key         | Type   | Required | Description                                  |
| :---------- | :----- | :------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| delivery    | string | Yes      | Actual delivery used: `inline` or `localPath`. Clients must inspect this field because a requested local path can fall back inline. |
| contentType | string | Yes      | MIME type of the returned image data.        |
| extension   | string | No       | File extension without a dot, derived from MIME type or source path. |
| data        | string | No       | Base64-encoded image bytes. Present for `inline` delivery. |
| localPath   | string | No       | Absolute, opaque Core-host path to a cached thumbnail. Present for `localPath` delivery. |
| typeTag     | string | Yes      | Canonical property tag that matched.         |

  }
}
```

### media.scrape

**Access:** All clients.

Start a metadata scraper run in the background.

Scraping enriches existing MediaDB records only. It does not create media rows; run `media.generate` first so the filesystem scanner has indexed the library. Scraping and media indexing are mutually exclusive, and only one scraper can run at a time.

Progress is reported with [media.scraping](./notifications.md#mediascraping) notifications and can be queried with `media.scrape.status`. Scraping pauses while media is running and resumes automatically when playback stops.

#### Parameters

An object:

| Key       | Type     | Required | Description                                                                 |
| :-------- | :------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| scraperId | string   | Yes      | Scraper ID from the `scrapers` method, for example `gamelist.xml`.          |
| systems   | string[] | No       | System IDs to scrape. Omit or pass an empty array to scrape all eligible systems. |
| force     | boolean  | No       | Re-scrape records that already have this scraper's sentinel tag. Default is false. |

#### Result

Returns `null` on success. The scraper continues after the response is sent.

#### Example

##### Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "a7b8c9d0-7a5d-11ef-9c7b-020304050607",
  "method": "media.scrape",
  "params": {
    "scraperId": "gamelist.xml",
    "systems": ["SNES", "NES"],
    "force": false
  }
}
```

##### Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "a7b8c9d0-7a5d-11ef-9c7b-020304050607",
  "result": null
}
```

### media.scrape.status

**Access:** All clients.

Return the latest known metadata scraper status.

This method behaves like `media` does for indexing status: clients can query the current scrape snapshot after opening a UI, then continue listening for `media.scraping` notifications. If no scrape has run since startup, the result is idle with `scraping: false`, `done: false`, and `state: "idle"`. Existing flat counter fields remain for compatibility; new UIs should prefer `currentSystem` for per-system progress and `totalSteps`/`currentStep`/`currentStepDisplay` for whole-run progress.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

| Key       | Type    | Required | Description                                                |
| :-------- | :------ | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |

| done      | boolean | Yes      | Whether the latest scrape reached a terminal state.        |
| paused    | boolean | Yes      | Whether the active scrape is paused because media is running or until resumed. |
| state     | string  | No       | Explicit lifecycle state: `idle`, `running`, `paused`, `completed`, `cancelled`, or `failed`. |
| error     | string  | No       | Fatal scrape error on failed terminal updates.             |
| totalSteps | integer | No      | Total systems in the scrape run, when known.               |
| currentStep | integer | No     | 1-based current system step, when known.                   |
| currentStepDisplay | string | No | Display name for the current system step, falling back to system ID. |
| currentSystem | object | No    | Per-system progress object with `systemId`, `systemName`, `processed`, `total`, `matched`, and `skipped`. |

  }
}
```

### media.clean.orphans

**Access:** All clients.

Delete media rows marked missing and remove orphaned related data.

This is intended for cleanup after files have been removed from disk and the media database has been refreshed. It removes missing `Media` rows, their tags and properties, and any titles that no longer have media rows. It does not run `VACUUM`; SQLite will reuse freed pages.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

| Key     | Type   | Required | Description                       |
| :------ | :----- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| deleted | number | Yes      | Number of missing media rows removed. |

  "result": {
    "deleted": 12
  }
}
```

### media.control

**Access:** All clients.

Send a control action to the active media's launcher.

Requires active media with a launcher that supports control capabilities. The available control actions depend on the launcher. Use the `launcherControls` field from `media.active` or `media` to discover supported actions.

Control actions run in a restricted runtime that blocks media-launching and playlist commands. Utility commands like `input.keyboard`, `execute`, `delay` and `echo` are allowed. The `execute` command bypasses the `allow_execute` allowlist for control scripts defined in launcher configuration.

#### Parameters

An object:

| Key    | Type   | Required | Description                                                       |
| :----- | :----- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| action | string | Yes      | The control action to execute (e.g., `"save_state"`, `"toggle_pause"`). |
| slot   | string | No       | Target media slot. Omit for primary media; use `"background"` to control background audio. |
| args   | object | No       | Optional key-value arguments for the control action. Values are strings. |

#### Result

Returns an empty object `{}` on success.

#### Example

##### Request

### media.title.parse

**Access:** All clients.

Preview title and slug generation for a media path without reading the filesystem or media database. This uses the same path parsing rules as media indexing.

#### Parameters

An object:

| Key      | Type   | Required | Description |
| :------- | :----- | :------- | :---------- |
| systemId | string | Yes      | System ID used to select game or media title-parsing rules. |
| path     | string | Yes      | Media path to parse. |

#### Result

| Key          | Type             | Required | Description |
| :----------- | :--------------- | :------- | :---------- |
| name         | string           | Yes      | Parsed display title. |
| slug         | string           | Yes      | Primary normalized title slug. |
| secondarySlug | string          | No       | Secondary slug generated for a subtitle when present. |
| slugLength   | number           | Yes      | Primary slug length in Unicode characters. |
| slugWordCount | number          | Yes      | Number of words represented by primary slug. |

#### Example

  "params": {
    "systemId": "NES",
    "path": "roms/nes/Tetris.nes"
  }
}
```

##### Response

    "name": "Tetris",
    "slug": "tetris",
    "slugLength": 6,
    "slugWordCount": 1
  }
}
```

### systems

**Access:** All clients.

List systems currently indexed or supported by an available launcher on the running platform. Virtual systems are also included.

Set `all` to include every system represented by the running platform's launcher definitions, even when its runtime dependency is currently unavailable. This is useful when selecting a specific system for its first media index. On MiSTer, a launcher whose FPGA core isn't installed on the SD card counts as unavailable, so without `all` the system list reflects only systems you can currently launch. See [launchers](#launchers) to check which core a launcher needs.

Responses include an exact non-missing `mediaCount` for each system when the media database count query succeeds. Supported systems with no indexed media have `mediaCount: 0`. The field is omitted if counts are unavailable, preserving compatibility with older clients and database-error fallback behavior.

Set `tags` to return only systems containing matching non-missing media. Tagged responses use `mediaCount` for the exact matching count and omit zero-match systems. Tag syntax and AND/NOT/OR operators match `media.search`. Tags remain the final filter when combined with `all`, so launcher-only systems with no matching media are omitted.

#### Parameters

| Key  | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                     |
| :--- | :------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| all  | boolean  | No       | Include systems with unavailable launchers. Defaults to `false`. Indexed systems remain listed. |
| tags | string[] | No       | Return systems with matching media. Uses the same tag syntax and operators as `media.search`.    |

#### Result

| Key     | Type                       | Required | Description                                                        |
| :------ | :------------------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| systems | [System](#system-object)[] | Yes      | Indexed, available, and optionally unavailable platform systems. Tagged requests include only positive-count systems. |

See [System object](#system-object).

### settings.update

**Access:** Requires `settings.write`. Changing `encryption` is localhost only. Online backup, play-history sync, and remote-control settings require localhost or authenticated admin, so legacy clients cannot change them.

Update one or more settings in-memory and save changes to disk.

This method will only write values which are supplied. Existing values will not be modified.

### settings.auth.claim

**Access:** Unauthenticated bootstrap.

Redeem a claim token against a remote auth server and store the resulting credentials in `auth.toml`.

This method performs trust discovery using the `.well-known/zaparoo` protocol. It first verifies that the claim URL's root domain supports auth (`auth: 1` in the well-known response), then redeems the claim token to obtain a bearer credential. If the root domain's well-known response includes a `trusted` list, each related domain is checked for bidirectional trust confirmation before extending the credential. Production claim URLs must use HTTPS. Plain HTTP is accepted only for loopback, private-network, or link-local development endpoints; public HTTP endpoints are rejected.

#### Parameters

An object:

| Key      | Type   | Required | Description                                                    |

| claimUrl | string | Yes      | HTTPS claim URL. HTTP is allowed only for loopback, private, or link-local development endpoints. |
| token    | string | Yes      | The one-time claim token to redeem.                            |

#### Result

    ]
  }
}
```

### settings.auth.status

**Access:** Unauthenticated bootstrap.

Report whether Core holds a stored bearer credential for an auth server URL. The check is local only: the token is never validated against the server and no token material is returned.

Status probes are only answered for official Zaparoo API hosts over HTTPS and for the configured remote backup base URL. Any other URL returns `linked: false` without revealing whether a credential exists.

#### Parameters

An object:

| Key | Type   | Required | Description                            |
| :-- | :----- | :------- | :------------------------------------- |
| url | string | Yes      | Auth server URL to check link state for. |

#### Result

| Key    | Type    | Required | Description                                              |
| :----- | :------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| linked | boolean | Yes      | Whether a stored bearer credential exists for the URL.   |

#### Example

##### Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "b2c3d4e5-auth-status-example",
  "method": "settings.auth.status",
  "params": {
    "url": "https://api.zaparoo.com"
  }
}
```

##### Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "b2c3d4e5-auth-status-example",
  "result": {
    "linked": true
  }
}
```

### settings.auth.unlink

**Access:** Localhost or admin.

Remove the device's online account credentials — the inverse of `settings.auth.link`. The claim/link flow tags every credential it stores with the root domain that created it (`linked_via` in `auth.toml`), so unlink removes the configured remote backup server's entry plus every entry tagged with it, whatever domains the server's trusted list contained at link time. Credentials for other domains, hand-written basic-auth entries, and API keys are untouched. Remote backup state is marked unlinked so the status UI prompts a re-link and the scheduler stops attempting remote backups.

Requires a localhost client or an authenticated admin client, including a valid static API-key admin.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

| Key     | Type     | Required | Description                                     |
| :------ | :------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| domains | string[] | Yes      | Domains whose stored credentials were removed.  |

#### Example

##### Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "c3d4e5f6-auth-unlink-example",
  "method": "settings.auth.unlink"
}
```

##### Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "c3d4e5f6-auth-unlink-example",
  "result": {
    "domains": ["https://api.zaparoo.com", "https://zpr.au"]
  }
}
```

### settings.auth.link

**Access:** Unauthenticated bootstrap.

Start a reverse device link flow (device-authorization style): Core requests a link from the auth server, returns a user code and verification URLs to display, then polls in the background until the user approves the link in their account. On approval the resulting claim token is redeemed through the same pipeline as `settings.auth.claim` and the credential is stored in `auth.toml`.

This method is deliberately available before client authentication. Remote HTTP POST still requires an address allowed by `allowed_ips`. Only one link flow can be pending at a time; starting another while one is pending returns an error. Progress is pushed via the [`auth.link.status`](./notifications.md#authlinkstatus) notification (with user code and verification URLs omitted) and can be polled with `settings.auth.link.status`.

#### Parameters

An object (optional):

| Key | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                          |
| :-- | :----- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| url | string | No       | Auth server base URL. Defaults to the official Zaparoo API. HTTP is allowed only for loopback, private, or link-local development endpoints. |

#### Result

A link status object:

| Key                     | Type   | Required | Description                                                       |
| :---------------------- | :----- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| status                  | string | Yes      | One of `none`, `pending`, `approved`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.   |
| userCode                | string | No       | Short code the user enters at the verification URL.               |
| verificationUrl         | string | No       | URL where the user approves the link.                             |
| verificationUrlComplete | string | No       | Verification URL with the user code included, for QR display.     |
| expiresAt               | string | No       | RFC 3339 time when the link request expires.                      |
| error                   | string | No       | Human-readable reason when `status` is `failed`.                  |

#### Example

```

### settings.auth.link.status

**Access:** Unauthenticated bootstrap with redacted output; localhost and admin receive full output. Members are rejected.

Return the state of the active link flow as a link status object (see `settings.auth.link`). When no flow has been started, `status` is `none`.

Access is tiered: localhost, paired admin, and API-key admin receive the full object including `userCode` and verification URLs. Unauthenticated callers receive only flow state; `userCode`, `verificationUrl`, and `verificationUrlComplete` are omitted. Paired member clients are forbidden.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

A link status object (see `settings.auth.link`).

#### Example

##### Request

```json

  }
}
```

### settings.auth.link.cancel

**Access:** Localhost or admin.

Cancel the pending link flow. Requires a localhost client or an authenticated admin client, including a valid static API-key admin. Returns the terminal `cancelled` status object with user code and verification URLs omitted. When no flow is pending, returns an error (`no active link request`).

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

A link status object (see `settings.auth.link`) with `status` set to `cancelled`.

#### Example

A remote API `401` marks device unlinked until a fresh link succeeds. Archives that fail ZIP header, manifest, hash, schema, or platform-policy validation return an RPC error without backup metadata.

## Playtime

### playtime

**Access:** All clients.

Query current playtime session status and usage statistics.

This method returns comprehensive information about the current playtime session, including active game time, cumulative session time, cooldown state, daily usage, and remaining time before limits are reached.

**Session States:**
- `reset` - No active session, ready to start new session
- `active` - Game currently running, time being tracked
- `cooldown` - Game stopped but session persists (within session reset timeout)

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

| Key                   | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                           |
| :-------------------- | :------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| state                 | string  | Yes      | Current session state: `"reset"`, `"active"`, or `"cooldown"`.                                        |
| sessionActive         | boolean | Yes      | Whether a game is currently running.                                                                  |
| limitsEnabled         | boolean | Yes      | Whether playtime limits are currently enabled for enforcement.                                        |
| sessionStarted        | string  | No       | ISO 8601 timestamp when current game started. Only present during `"active"` state.                   |
| sessionDuration       | string  | No       | Total time in current session (Go duration format). Present during `"active"` and `"cooldown"` states. |
| sessionCumulativeTime | string  | No       | Cumulative time from previous games in session. Present during `"active"` and `"cooldown"` states.    |
| sessionRemaining      | string  | No       | Time remaining before session limit reached. Only present if session limit is configured.             |
| cooldownRemaining     | string  | No       | Time until session auto-resets. Only present during `"cooldown"` state.                               |
| dailyUsageToday       | string  | No       | Total playtime accumulated today. Available in all states when data is available.                     |
| dailyRemaining        | string  | No       | Time remaining before daily limit reached. Available in all states if daily limit is configured.      |
| sessionExtension      | string  | No       | Extra time granted to the current session on top of the configured session limit. Omitted when nothing was granted. |
| sessionExtendedUntil  | string  | No       | RFC 3339 timestamp when a session-limit waiver lapses. While set, the session limit is not enforced and `sessionRemaining` is omitted; the daily limit still applies. |

**Note:** All duration fields use Go's duration format (e.g., `"1h30m45s"`, `"45m"`, `"2h"`).

`sessionRemaining` already accounts for any granted extension, so a client showing time left needs no extra arithmetic. `sessionExtension` is reported separately so a client can show that time was granted rather than silently displaying a larger allowance. See [`playtime.extend`](#playtimeextend).

### playtime.extend

**Access:** `playtime.extend` capability (localhost, or an authenticated admin client).

Grant extra time to the playtime session currently being limited, without stopping what is playing and without changing any configured limit.

The recipient is never named by the caller: a grant always applies to the profile playtime is being enforced against at that moment, so it cannot be aimed at someone else's session. A `duration` grant is held against the current session only and is cleared when that session resets — when a different profile becomes active, when the cooldown window expires, or when limits are disabled. A `today` waiver survives all three because it is day-scoped: it lapses at the next local midnight and nowhere else.

**The daily limit is never affected.** It remains the hard ceiling in both modes; raising it is a settings change, not a grant.

**Modes:**

- `duration` adds time to the current session's allowance. It requires a session to extend, so it is accepted during `active` and `cooldown` states but rejected during `reset`. Cooldown is the common case: the limit stopped the game and the player is about to relaunch.
- `today` waives the session limit for the recipient profile until the next local midnight. It is day-scoped rather than session-scoped, so it is accepted in any state, and it is rejected when the system clock is unreliable.

A single duration grant must be between 1 minute and 24 hours, and the total accumulated across one session is capped at 24 hours. A grant that would exceed the cap is rejected rather than reduced, so a caller is never told less time was added than it asked for.

The same grant can also be made by scanning a physical card holding `**playtime.extend`, authorized by an administrator profile's switch ID rather than by a paired client.

#### Parameters

| Key       | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                      |
| :-------- | :----- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mode      | string | Yes      | `"duration"` or `"today"`.                                                                                       |
| duration  | string | No       | Time to add, in Go duration format (e.g. `"15m"`, `"1h30m"`). Required for `"duration"` mode, ignored for `"today"`. |
| requestId | string | No       | Idempotency key. Repeating a request ID reports the original grant instead of adding more time.                  |

#### Result

| Key              | Type    | Required | Description                                                                        |
| :--------------- | :------ | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mode             | string  | Yes      | The mode that was applied.                                                         |
| replayed         | boolean | Yes      | True when a repeated `requestId` matched an earlier grant and no time was added.    |
| duration         | string  | No       | Time this grant added. Omitted for `"today"`.                                       |
| expires          | string  | No       | RFC 3339 timestamp when a `"today"` waiver lapses. Omitted for `"duration"`.         |
| sessionExtension | string  | No       | The session's accumulated extension after this grant.                              |
| profileId        | string  | No       | Recipient profile. Omitted for the shared profile.                                 |

A successful grant emits [`playtime.extended`](./notifications.md#playtimeextended). A replayed request granted nothing, so it emits no notification.

## Profiles

Profiles are lightweight runtime identities: named buckets of preferences, limits, and profile-owned data. One profile is active per device at a time, switched via the API or by scanning an NFC card containing the profile's switch ID (`**profile:<switchId>`). Profile roles (`admin` or `member`) are separate from paired-client roles: profile roles identify who may authorize local household management, while client roles describe which remote device may call privileged APIs.

When no personal profile is active the device is on the implicit **shared profile** — the device as it behaves when nobody is signed in. The shared profile's playtime limits are the global config limits, its history is unattributed, and it owns everything the device did before profiles existed. Deactivating means switching to the shared profile. To stop the shared profile launching media (parking the device until someone identifies themselves), enable the `profilesRequireForLaunch` setting (see [settings](#settings)).

A profile's **switch ID is a bearer credential**: presenting it — by scanning the card it is written on, or by sending it over the API — authorizes switching to that profile with no PIN, on every path. Switch IDs are therefore only returned to clients with `profiles.manage` for card-writing. This includes localhost, paired admins, and legacy unpaired remote clients when encryption is disabled; paired members never see them. The optional 4-8 digit **PIN** protects the remaining path: switching by `profileId` picked from the visible profile list. Leaving a profile is always free — PINs gate entry only.

**Data swapping.** On supported platforms (currently MiSTer), profile-owned platform data follows the active profile. This includes saved progress and supported account-specific settings; exact items depend on the platform and installed integrations. The shared profile continues to use the platform's existing data, and creating profiles does not move that data. Device-owned settings remain shared across profiles.

A swap requested while media is running is deferred until it stops, so the running session keeps the data it launched with. Progress and failures are reported by the [`profiles.data`](notifications.md#profilesdata) notification; the `profilesSwapData` setting turns swapping off. Deleting a profile does not delete its profile-owned platform data.

**Administration and trust model.** The first profile is created as `admin` and must have a PIN; later profiles default `member`. The first paired client is `admin`; later pairings default `member`. Sensitive local UIs call `profiles.verify`, confirm the returned profile has the `admin` role, then send the ordinary management request. This is a client-side nuisance gate for parental and kiosk controls, not cryptographic request authorization; no unlock session is retained. Admin paired clients use their client capability directly. The last admin profile/client cannot be removed or demoted. Profiles remain a household convenience boundary, comparable to TV parental controls — not OS account security. Anyone with OS access still owns the device, and while `service.encryption` is off an unpaired remote client retains legacy admin API capability, apart from the capabilities that require an authenticated connection — currently `update.apply`. Enabling encryption makes paired-client restrictions enforceable.

### profiles

**Access:** All clients. `switchId` is returned only to clients with `profiles.manage`.

List all profiles.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

| Key      | Type                         | Required | Description       |
| :------- | :--------------------------- | :------- | :---------------- |
| profiles | [Profile](#profile-object)[] | Yes      | List of profiles. |

### profiles.new

**Access:** Requires `profiles.manage`.

Create a new profile. Local UIs may use `profiles.verify` as a nuisance gate. The switch ID is generated automatically; write it to a card as `**profile:<switchId>`.

#### Parameters

| Key           | Type    | Required | Description                                                      |
| :------------ | :------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name          | string  | Yes      | Display name.                                                    |
| role          | string  | No       | `admin` or `member`; later profiles default member. First profile is always admin. |
| pin           | string  | No       | Optional 4-8 digit PIN required to switch by `profileId`; mandatory for admin profiles. |
| limitsEnabled | boolean | No       | Playtime limits enabled override.                                |
| dailyLimit    | string  | No       | Daily limit duration override.                                   |
| sessionLimit  | string  | No       | Session limit duration override.                                 |

#### Result

The created [profile object](#profile-object).

### profiles.update

**Access:** Requires `profiles.manage`.

Update a profile. Local UIs may gate this action with `profiles.verify`. Migrated profiles without an administrator may still be recovered locally. Omitted fields are unchanged. If the updated profile is currently active, its limit changes apply immediately (without resetting the running session).

#### Parameters

| Key                | Type    | Required | Description                                                            |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| profileId          | string  | Yes      | Profile to update.                                                     |
| name               | string  | No       | New display name.                                                      |
| role               | string  | No       | Change between `admin` and `member`; final admin cannot be demoted.    |
| pin                | string  | No       | Set or replace the PIN; admin profiles must retain one.                |
| clearPin           | boolean | No       | Remove the PIN.                                                        |
| limitsEnabled      | boolean | No       | Playtime limits enabled override.                                      |
| dailyLimit         | string  | No       | Daily limit duration override.                                         |
| sessionLimit       | string  | No       | Session limit duration override.                                       |
| clearLimits        | boolean | No       | Reset all limit overrides back to inheriting the global config, before any limit fields in the same request are applied. |
| regenerateSwitchId | boolean | No       | Issue a new switch ID (lost-card replacement). Old cards stop working. |

#### Result

The updated [profile object](#profile-object).

### profiles.delete

**Access:** Requires `profiles.manage`.

Delete a profile. Local UIs may gate this action with `profiles.verify`. The final admin profile cannot be deleted. If it is active, the device switches to the shared profile. Past play history keeps its attribution.

#### Parameters

| Key       | Type   | Required | Description        |
| :-------- | :----- | :------- | :----------------- |
| profileId       | string | Yes      | Profile to delete.                                      |

#### Result

Null.

### profiles.active

**Access:** All clients.

Get the device's currently active profile.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

The active profile (a subset of the [profile object](#profile-object) without `switchId` and timestamps), or null when no profile is active.

### profiles.switch

**Access:** All clients. Profile PIN or switch ID may still be required.

Switch the device's active profile. Switching by `profileId` requires the profile's PIN when one is set. Switching by `switchId` never requires a PIN: the switch ID is a bearer credential, and presenting it is equivalent to scanning the profile's card. Calling with neither `profileId` nor `switchId` switches to the shared profile (deactivates), which never requires a PIN. Providing both is an error.

If a game is running when the profile changes, its playtime keeps counting against the profile that launched it: switching to another profile starts a fresh limit session for the new person, while deactivating leaves the launch profile's limits in force until the media stops.

#### Parameters

| Key       | Type   | Required | Description                                            |
| :-------- | :----- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| profileId | string | No       | Profile to activate, by ID. Requires `pin` when the profile has one. |
| switchId  | string | No       | Profile to activate, by switch ID (bearer credential; no PIN needed). |
| pin       | string | No       | The profile's PIN, for `profileId` switching.          |

#### Result

The new active profile, or null when deactivated (shared profile).

### profiles.verify

**Access:** All clients. Requires valid profile PIN or switch ID.

Verify a profile credential **without switching**: either a profile ID plus its PIN, or a switch ID (a bearer credential — resolving it is the verification, same as scanning the card). Success returns the profile's identity and changes nothing on the device: no session, no active-profile change, no server-side grant of any kind. Clients use this to gate their own ad-hoc UI items behind a credential — e.g. a kiosk frontend requiring a parent's PIN before opening its settings screen. The security of whatever the client unlocks is entirely the client's responsibility.

PIN attempts share the same per-profile rate limiter as `profiles.switch`, so this method cannot be used to brute-force a PIN any faster than switching attempts could.

#### Parameters

| Key       | Type   | Required | Description                                              |
| :-------- | :----- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| profileId | string | No       | Profile to verify against. Requires `pin` when the profile has one. |
| switchId  | string | No       | Verify by switch ID (bearer credential; no PIN needed).  |
| pin       | string | No       | The profile's PIN, for `profileId` verification.         |

Exactly one of `profileId` or `switchId` is required.

#### Result

| Key       | Type    | Required | Description                              |
| :-------- | :------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| profileId | string  | Yes      | ID of the verified profile.              |
| name      | string  | Yes      | Display name of the verified profile.    |
| role      | string  | Yes      | Profile role (`admin` or `member`).      |
| hasPin    | boolean | Yes      | Whether the profile has a PIN set.       |

Verification failure (wrong PIN, unknown profile or switch ID, rate limited) returns an error, using the same errors as `profiles.switch`.

## Mappings

Mappings are used to modify the contents of tokens before they're launched, based on different types of matching parameters. Stored mappings are queried before every launch and applied to the token if there's a match. This allows, for example, adding ZapScript to a read-only NFC tag based on its UID.

### mappings

**Access:** All clients.

List all mappings.

Returns a list of all active and inactive mappings entries stored on server.

#### Parameters

None.

## Readers

### readers

**Access:** All clients.

List all currently connected readers and their capabilities.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

| Key               | Type                       | Required | Description                         |
| :---------------- | :------------------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------- |
| readers           | [ReaderInfo](#reader-info-object)[] | Yes      | A list of all connected readers.    |
| holdOwnerReaderId | string                     | No       | ID of the reader whose token is currently tracked as the owner of the running media. Omitted when no token is tracked. |
| holdScanMode      | string                     | No       | Effective scan mode of that token, including a `#tap` or `#hold` override on the token itself. A tracked owner can be `tap`: the token still owns the running media, its removal just does not exit. This is resolved exactly as the removal will resolve it, so an owner whose reader has since disconnected reports `hold` — the decision made while that reader was present still stands. |

##### Reader info object

| driver       | string   | Yes      | Driver type for the reader (e.g., `"pn532"`, `"acr122pcsc"`, `"file"`). |
| info         | string   | Yes      | Human-readable information about the reader.  |
| scanMode     | string   | Yes      | Effective scan mode for this reader (`"tap"` or `"hold"`), resolving its `[[readers.connect]]` entry, then its `[readers.drivers.<id>]` entry, then the global `readers.scan.mode`. |
| connected    | boolean  | Yes      | Whether the reader is currently connected.    |
| capabilities | string[] | Yes      | List of capabilities supported by the reader. |

| :------- | :----- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| readerId | string | No       | ID of a specific reader to cancel write on. If omitted, cancels on all readers. |

#### Result

Returns `null` on success.

#### Example

##### Request

## Launchers

### launchers

**Access:** All clients.

List all launchers known to the running service. Suitable for populating a UI launcher picker (for example, when assigning a per-system default via [settings.update](#settingsupdate)).

#### Parameters

| Key         | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                        |
| :---------- | :------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| systems     | string[] | No       | Case-insensitive list of system IDs to restrict results to. A missing key or empty list returns every launcher. Values not matching any launcher's system return no launchers for that value, rather than an error, since launcher system IDs can be launchable or virtual systems outside the standard system list. |
| fuzzySystem | boolean  | No       | Also resolve a system-ID alias to its canonical ID before matching (e.g., `"megadrive"` matches `"Genesis"`). Matching is always case-insensitive regardless of this flag.       |

The unfiltered response can be large on platforms with many launchers (250+ on MiSTer). Pass `systems` to scope the request when looking up a specific system's launchers.

#### Result

| Key       | Type                                  | Required | Description                  |

| systemId            | string   | No       | The system this launcher targets. Omitted for generic launchers without a fixed system.                |
| systemName          | string   | No       | Human-readable system name resolved from system metadata. Omitted when no metadata is available.       |
| groups              | string[] | No       | Group names this launcher belongs to. Group names are valid values for `systemDefaults.launcher`.      |
| available           | boolean  | Yes      | Whether this launcher's runtime dependencies are currently satisfied.                                  |
| availabilityReason  | string   | No       | Why the launcher is unavailable. Omitted when `available` is `true`.                                   |
| default             | boolean  | No       | Whether this launcher is the configured default for its system (`systemDefaults.launcher`, matched by launcher ID or by any of `groups`). Omitted (implicitly `false`) otherwise.                                    |
| backend             | string   | No       | What kind of thing this launcher runs. Currently only `mister_core` is emitted. Omitted when the platform has nothing to say about this launcher. Clients must ignore backend values they don't recognize. |
| misterCore          | [MisterCoreInfo](#mistercoreinfo-object) | No | Present when `backend` is `mister_core` and the core is installed. Absent when the core isn't installed; `available` and `availabilityReason` say why. |

##### MisterCoreInfo object

| Key     | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                     |

### clients.current

**Access:** All clients.

Return effective access, pairing status, paired role, and named capabilities for current connection. This method is available to every connection accepted by API transport.

`access` is one of `localhost`, `member`, `admin`, or `legacy`. A valid static API key reports `access: "admin"` with `paired: false` and `role: null`. `role` remains the stored paired role for authenticated paired connections, including paired localhost connections, and is `null` for unpaired localhost, API-key admin, and legacy. Clients should use capability presence for corresponding UI gates and treat role as display-only. Capability names currently include `profiles.manage`, `settings.write`, `input`, `screenshot`, and `update.apply`; the array does not enumerate every callable RPC method.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Result

| Key          | Type               | Description                                                  |

| access       | string             | Effective public authority: `localhost`, `member`, `admin`, or `legacy`. |
| paired       | boolean            | Whether connection carries an authenticated paired identity. |
| role         | string or `null`   | Paired client role, otherwise `null`.                        |
| capabilities | array of strings   | Effective named capabilities granted to current connection.  |

#### Example

##### Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",

## Remote control

Remote control lets the Zaparoo Online account a device is linked to send a fixed set of commands to it (search and browse the media library, list systems and launchers, launch, stop, run a MiSTer script) through the Zaparoo Online API. It is off until the device owner turns on `remoteControlEnabled` in [settings.update](#settingsupdate), and is turned off again automatically whenever the account is linked or unlinked. Every command that reaches the device is recorded in a local ledger.

### remote.activity

**Access:** Localhost and authenticated admin clients only.

Return the current remote control status and the most recent entries from the remote command ledger, as an owner-facing record of what the linked account's remote commands have done on this device.

#### Parameters

| Key   | Type   | Required | Description                                                     |

## Input

Direct platform input control for remote control use cases. These methods bypass the token pipeline entirely: no hooks, history, or sound effects are triggered.

The input macro format is identical to what goes after the `:` in a ZapScript `input.keyboard` or `input.gamepad` command on a token. Each character is a separate keypress, `{...}` groups are special keys/combos, and `\` is the escape character. Macros also support `{delay:duration}`, `{hold:key:duration}`, `{press:key}`, and `{release:key}`. Press and release have short forms `{_key}` and `{^key}`. Delay and explicit hold durations are limited to 30 seconds.

Persistent `{press:key}` and `{release:key}` input is available only over supported WebSocket input sessions. A press remains held across requests from that WebSocket until its matching release. Each WebSocket owns its held keys and buttons; one connection cannot release another connection's input. Core releases all owned input when the WebSocket disconnects, input execution fails, or Core shuts down. HTTP JSON-RPC requests reject persistent press and release tokens because HTTP has no durable session lifecycle.

### input.keyboard

**Access:** Requires `input`.

Press keyboard keys using the ZapScript input macro format.

#### Parameters

An object:

| Key  | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| :--- | :----- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| keys | string | Yes      | Input macro string. Each character is a keypress, `{...}` for special keys (e.g. `{enter}`, `{f9}`, `{ctrl+q}`). WebSocket requests may use `{press:key}` and `{release:key}` to hold a key across requests. |

#### Result

Returns `null` on success.

## Updates

### update.check

**Access:** Localhost or any paired client.

Check if a newer version of Zaparoo Core is available. Returns version information, release notes, and everything a client needs to decide what to offer: whether the device is eligible for updates at all, whether the release has reached this device yet, and what is currently stopping one being installed.

A check makes the device fetch and verify signed release metadata and write the result to its data directory, which is why it is not open to unpaired remote clients.

On development builds, `updateAvailable` is always `false` and `eligibility` is `development`.

#### Parameters

None.

| autoInstall     | boolean | Yes      | Whether the device installs updates on its own. Mirrors the `updateInstall` setting.                                                                                |
| latestVersion   | string  | No       | The latest available version (if the check succeeded).                                                                                                               |

| eligibility     | string  | No       | Whether this install can take OTA updates: `eligible`, `development`, `unsupported` (this install cannot be replaced in place, such as a Windows install under a directory Zaparoo cannot write to), or `managed` (a package manager owns the install, so it should do the installing). An install that cannot be replaced reports `unsupported` even when a package manager owns it, because that is the one an install is actually refused for. |
| checkedAt       | string  | No       | RFC3339 timestamp of when the release metadata was last fetched.                                                                                                     |
| rolloutHeld     | boolean | No       | The release is newer but has not reached this device's share of the fleet yet. Applying it by hand still works; automatic installs wait.                              |
| blockedBy       | object  | No       | What is stopping an update being applied right now. Absent when nothing is.                                                                                          |
| deferredReason  | string  | No       | Why an automatic install has been putting this version off. Same values as `blockedBy.reason`.                                                                       |
| deferredSince   | string  | No       | RFC3339 timestamp of when this version was first put off. After 24 hours an automatic install goes ahead through the signals that expire.                             |
| lastResult      | object  | No       | How the previous update finished. Present until a newer result replaces it.                                                                                          |

`blockedBy` is what a client should read before offering an update: hide or disable the button when `forceable` is false, and offer to go ahead when it is true.

```

### update.apply

**Access:** Requires `update.apply`.

Download and apply the latest available update, then gracefully restart the service. The response is sent to the client before the restart occurs.

Before anything is downloaded the device checks that it is safe to install: nothing writing to the databases, no backup or token write in progress, nothing playing, and enough battery. A refusal comes back as an error whose message is the same text `update.check` reports in `blockedBy.message`. Call `update.check` first to know in advance, and whether `force` would get past it.

The battery is checked twice — once before the download and again immediately before the install begins — because a download long enough to matter is also long enough to outlive a charger being unplugged.

This method has no request timeout: the download and install run to completion or unwind on their own. Applying an update is treated as low priority, so it does not delay reader scans or playback control.

While it runs, the device sends [`update.state`](notifications.md#updatestate) notifications.

#### Parameters

| Key   | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| :---- | :------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| force | boolean | No       | Go ahead through the signals `update.check` reports as `forceable`, such as media playing that the restart will close. It does not get past anything that risks data or a device without the power to finish. Defaults to false. |

Parameters may be omitted entirely, which is the same as `force: false`.
