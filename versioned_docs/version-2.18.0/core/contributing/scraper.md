# Scraper Subsystem

The scraper subsystem enriches existing MediaDB records with metadata from external sources. The filesystem scanner owns record creation; scrapers update records that already exist.

Current scraper implementations:

- `gamelist.xml` imports EmulationStation metadata such as developer, publisher, genre, rating, player count, descriptions, artwork paths, videos, manuals, and ScreenScraper game IDs. It also reads `<folder>` entries and `<game>` entries whose path is a directory.
- `media-folder` imports image paths from EmulationStation-style `media/` folders under each system folder. It does not read `gamelist.xml`, download assets, or write non-image metadata. Indexed directories also match artwork named after themselves, whether or not they collapse to a launch target. Directory image properties use stable `(system, path)` identities and each successfully completed system atomically replaces its prior directory snapshot, removing stale folder artwork. A force run (re-scrape) also deletes stale media image properties whose paths match the same local media-folder convention and whose replacement file is no longer found.
- `mister-docs` imports locally installed MiSTer Downloader artwork, manuals, game metadata, and English synopses from `docs/<system>/` directories. It is registered only on MiSTer and never downloads source assets itself.
- `mister-arcade` imports the MiSTer arcade catalog's metadata onto indexed `.mra` rows, keyed by the MAME set name declared inside each descriptor. It is registered on MiSTer and MiSTeX, reads the catalog those platforms already cache and embed, and runs automatically after arcade indexing.
- `pinup-popper` imports PinUP Popper's own table metadata (year, manufacturer, player count, type, category, theme, notes) and wheel, playfield, backglass and flyer images for `Pinball` media indexed by the PinUP Popper launcher. It is registered only on Windows when a PinUP Popper installation is available, and reads `PUPDatabase.db` and the emulator media folders in place.

## Registration And API Lifecycle

Platforms expose available scrapers with:

```go
Scrapers(*config.Instance) map[string]platforms.Scraper
```

`platforms.Scraper` carries `ID`, `Name`, `SupportedSystemIDs`, optional `CustomOpts`, and a `Scrape` callback. The callback receives context, config, platform, filesystem, database, shared scrape options, custom options, and an update channel.

`media.scrape` looks up the requested `scraperId` from `env.Platform.Scrapers(env.Config)`, rejects the request if media indexing or another scrape is active, creates an app-scoped cancelable context, starts the scraper in the background, tracks it as a MediaDB background operation, and publishes `media.scraping` notifications.

`media.scrape.status` returns the latest in-memory status snapshot plus a fresh scraped-count query. `media.scrape.cancel` durably cancels current and queued scrape work, including jobs waiting for optimization. A persistence failure is returned as an error, not acknowledged as successful cancellation. `media.scrape.resume` resumes the shared scrape pauser. Scraping and indexing are mutually exclusive.

### Ordinary Jobs After Indexing

A scraper can declare `SupportsFillMissing` and bind `AutoScrapeLaunchers` to selected launcher IDs. PinUP Popper and `mister-arcade` opt in; the remaining scrapers are manual. Both filesystem launchers and custom scanners can supply eligible contributions. Empty, failed, unavailable or unrelated sources do not request a job, and failed/cancelled indexes do not submit their summary.

The sequence is **index → existing optimization → ordinary scraping**. Successful indexing persists eligible jobs before its final notification. The existing service recovery watcher starts them after optimization releases its write lease; there is no separate automatic-job worker. All jobs use the same scrape pauser, gameplay throttling, progress notifications and executor.

The config-backed operation record holds one current job and an ordered pending list, bounded to 64 total jobs. Identical pending scopes/policies are deduplicated. A new manual request receives a conflict rather than overwriting pending work. Versioned records carry authoritative status; legacy records are readable and upgraded when resumed. Unknown versions fail closed.

Orderly shutdown drains source execution but retains unfinished jobs and run markers. Restart resumes those options and skips committed row work. Advancement is persisted before the previous job's markers are removed. Ordinary source failures allow unrelated pending jobs to continue; persistence failures stop advancement, and database corruption uses existing recovery. A failed final job is not retried indefinitely by the watcher.

Indexing is only a trigger, not a durable parent workflow: use `media.scrape.cancel` after indexing finishes, not `media.generate.cancel`. A crash between successful indexing and queue persistence can require another index or manual request. Once accepted into the queue, a job survives restart.

### Fill-Missing Policy

Index-triggered jobs only fill missing metadata. A property is missing when no row of that type exists—not when its text is empty or its artwork file has disappeared. Existing exclusive tag values remain; additive tags may gain values. Nothing is automatically replaced or deleted.

These checks and inserts share the existing single/batch scrape transaction. Fill-missing runs reconsider rows carrying a permanent scraper sentinel, so later indexes can fill newly available fields. Per-run markers still skip committed work within a resumed job. Popper orders targets by media path to make shared-title fills deterministic. Manual non-force and force write policies remain unchanged.

## Scoped Runs

`media.scrape` accepts an optional [scope](../api/methods.md#scope): a media ID, an exact system/file path, or a system-bound directory subtree. Existing `systems` requests retain their behavior.

The handler resolves scope while holding the media-write lease and persists `database.ScrapeScope` with the operation. An item pins its ID, system, and canonical path; a subtree pins its system and lexical directory boundary. Restart recovery validates the stored scope and never substitutes an entire system. These additive fields live in the existing `DBConfig` operation JSON, not a new database table.

`GetScrapeMedia` and `GetScopedScrapeMediaIDs` query only selected media, titles, and sentinel/run markers. `ScrapeOptions.SystemIDs()` makes the normalized scope authoritative. All three scrapers propagate it to their selection queries and restrict force cleanup to selected media and their titles. Shared title updates remain visible on sibling ROMs.

Scoped gamelist matching requires a selected path, a verified container/CD reference, or a Companion `.slug` title reference. It does not use unrestricted slug-only or basename-only fallback, which could make an unrelated source record appear unambiguous after narrowing the index. Container resolution consults full directory context without loading every system row, so selecting one file does not invent a single-game folder.

Scoped progress counts selected media rather than source records. The shared scoped writer validates target identities and deduplicates writes. Source XML/docs files may still require parsing, but selection does not load whole-system media/title lists. Library-wide `totalScraped` status counts are unchanged.

## Run Loop

There is no generic source-record scrape loop. `pkg/database/scraper/run.go` only provides a small helper for wrapping callback/channel startup. The `gamelist.xml` implementation owns its loop in `GamelistXMLScraper.scrapeLoop`.

For each system, the normal loop:

1. Resolves target systems from indexed MediaDB systems and platform launcher paths.
2. Runs ZaparooCompanion processing first. This is a special path; see [ZaparooCompanion Entries](#zaparoocompanion-entries).
3. Loads eligible indexed titles for slug matching (`force=true` loads all titles; otherwise titles without the scraper sentinel are loaded).
4. Loads indexed media rows for the system.
5. With `force=false`, removes media rows that already have sentinel tag `scraper.gamelist.xml:scraped` from path fallback candidates.
6. Loads `gamelist.xml` from each ROM root.
7. Resolves each `<game>` path under its ROM root.
8. Computes the same display-name slug used by the original scraper and prefers that title match.
9. Uses the resolved path to select the concrete Media row for the slug-matched title when possible; otherwise falls back to the first Media row for that title.
10. If slug matching fails, falls back to case-insensitive path matching so otherwise missed records can still scrape.
11. Maps XML fields to media-level tags/properties plus title-level shared tags/properties.
12. Writes metadata through `MediaDB.ApplyScrapeResult`.
13. Writes the scraper sentinel tag to the selected Media row last inside the same transaction.
14. Emits progress updates and a final done update.

The sentinel tag format is `scraper.<id>:scraped`, for example `scraper.gamelist.xml:scraped`. Writing it last is intentional: if a normal record write fails, the transaction rolls back and the missing sentinel leaves that media row eligible for retry.

Force scrapes also persist a run ID and write `scraper-run.<id>:<run-id>` to each media row completed in that operation. If Core restarts mid-force-scrape, resume reuses that run ID and skips rows already marked for the same run while still refreshing older rows that only had the normal sentinel. Run markers are removed after durable completion/advancement or cancellation. Unfinished and failed work retains its markers; a completed job's markers are not cleared before its durable queue position changes.

In the gamelist loop, per-record write failures are non-fatal: they increment `Skipped`, emit `Err`, and continue. A `gamelist.xml` that exists but cannot be read or parsed (invalid XML, over the size or entry limit) is also non-fatal: it emits `Err` as a `scraper.SourceError` naming the file, the run continues with the system's other roots, and the API layer turns the collected source errors into one inbox warning when the job ends. A `<game>` or `<folder>` entry whose numeric or boolean field does not parse is dropped on its own and counted as `skipped_entries` in the load log line; the rest of the file still imports. The size limit is per platform: platforms reporting `ResourceConstrained`, such as MiSTer, keep a 16 MB limit because every decoded entry is held for the length of the scrape, while other platforms allow 128 MB. A library too large for its device imports through media folders instead. Popper instead treats write failures as fatal so partially committed fill-missing work cannot be reported as successfully completed. Fatal setup/load/database errors end the run with a terminal update unless caused by context cancellation.

## Tags And Properties

The DB supports tags/properties at both media and title scope. Normal `gamelist.xml` scraping writes per-ROM `region`/`lang` tags and shared title metadata.

| Storage | Scope | Current normal `gamelist.xml` use |
|---|---|---|
| `MediaTags` | ROM-level variant metadata | region, lang, scraper sentinel |
| `MediaTitleTags` | Title-level shared metadata | developer, publisher, year, rating, genre, players, arcadeboard, search (franchise) |
| `MediaTitleProperties` | Title-level shared static content | description, XML game ID |
| `MediaProperties` | ROM-level static content | artwork paths, video path, manual path for normal `gamelist.xml` entries |

Tag exclusivity is controlled by `TagTypes.IsExclusive`. Exclusive types replace existing values for that type; additive types accumulate distinct values. The scraper write path groups tags by type and applies that behavior in `upsertTags`.

### Tag rules

Tags are meant to be as stable as practical: a filter written today must mean the same thing next year, on every device, whichever source the metadata came from. So a scraper does not decide what tags exist. Every tag type has a rule in `pkg/database/tags/rules.go` (`TagRules`), and every type is exactly one of three kinds:

| Kind | Types | What a value must be |
|---|---|---|
| Closed list | every type not listed below, including `genre`, `region`, `lang`, `arcadeboard`, `players`, `input`, `search` | one of the type's values in `CanonicalTagDefinitions` |
| Strict format | `year`, `builddate`, `rating`, `disc`, `disctotal`, `track`, `season`, `episode`, `issue`, `volume`, `set`, `alt`, `rev`, `patch`, `extension`, `mameparent`, `user`, and the `scraper.<id>` / `scraper-run.<id>` bookkeeping types | a value matching the type's rule, such as a year from 1950 to 2099, a real `YYYY-MM-DD` date, a rating from 0 to 100, a positive disc number, or a listed patch label with an optional version |
| Free text | `developer`, `publisher`, `credit` only | a company name in the form `NormalizeCompanyName` produces: lower-case words joined by single dashes |

Company names are the only free text because they are the only values that cannot be listed. Adding a free-text type is a design change, not a scraper detail; `TestFreeTextTypesAreOnlyCompanyNames` exists to make that visible.

What this means for a scraper:

- **Map or drop.** A scraper maps its source's wording onto an existing canonical value, through a table in its package or a shared lookup (`tags.LookupRegionWord`, `LookupLanguageWord`, `LookupArcadeBoard`, `LookupFranchise`). A source value with no mapping is dropped, never stored as it was written. Genres follow the GameDataBase taxonomy (`shmup:v`, `action:platformer`, `parlor:pinball`), series are `search:franchise:<name>`, and boards are `arcadeboard:<vendor>:<board>`.
- **Say what was dropped.** Record each dropped value with `scraper.UnmappedValues.Note` and call `LogSummary` once at the end of a run. The summary is logged at info with counts and examples per tag type, so the mapping tables can be grown from what real sources contain.
- **No labels on shared values.** A closed or format value is one row shared by every title that carries it, so it has no per-source display name. Only free-text tags keep the source's spelling as a label (`t-and-e-soft` labelled `T&E Soft`).
- **Adding a value** means adding a `TagValue` constant to `tag_values.go` and listing it under its type in `CanonicalTagDefinitions`, then mapping to it. Tests assert that every listed value satisfies its type's rule and that every declared tag type has a rule.

MediaDB enforces the rules on every write path — scrape writes, `UpsertMediaTags`/`UpsertMediaTitleTags`, the scanner's staging, user flags and deck membership, and the legacy `InsertTag`/`InsertTagType` — so a value that slips past a scraper is refused and logged at warn rather than stored. When the vocabulary changes between releases, the next index run's seeding pass removes stored types and values the new rules refuse, together with every link to them (`sqlPruneOffVocabularyTags`).

Each scraper's tests call `scrapertest.RequireValidWrite` on every write they build, and the MiSTer arcade catalog tests fail when the pinned catalog snapshot holds a category, platform or series that nothing maps, so refreshing the snapshot forces the new values to be curated.

Property rows are keyed by entity and property type tag. Re-scraping the same property type updates the row in place and preserves row DBID.

Path-backed properties persist their text path and optional `BlobDBID`; the property tables do not persist the `ContentType` computed by the mapper for path values. Blob-backed properties expose content type from `MediaBlobs`. API responses infer path-backed content type and extension from the stored path when DB content type is empty.

Normal gamelist artwork is media-level so regional or language variants can carry different image paths while sharing one title. `media.image` checks media-level properties before title-level properties. If an older scrape left title-level artwork behind, run a force scrape to refresh media-level artwork; no migration removes old title properties.

## Media-level Sentinel Invariant

Normal `gamelist.xml` entries prefer slug/title matching, then use path matching to select the concrete Media row when possible. If no slug match exists, path-only fallback can still select a Media row. The sentinel is written to the same Media row that receives ROM-level tags such as `region` and `lang` plus ROM-level file properties such as artwork.

Title metadata remains shared by `MediaTitleDBID`, so multiple ROM variants can write the same title-level tags/properties. Rewrites are idempotent: exclusive title tags replace same-type values, additive tags are inserted-or-ignored, and properties upsert by type. Media-level properties upsert per concrete Media row, preventing regional artwork variants from overwriting each other.

## gamelist.xml Behavior

`GamelistXMLScraper` scans each system ROM root for `gamelist.xml`. Regular `<game>` entries are resolved to absolute paths under the system ROM root. The scraper first matches the entry to an existing title by the original display-name slug behavior, then uses the resolved path to choose the concrete Media row for that title when possible. If slug matching finds a title but the path does not identify a Media row for that title, only title-level metadata is written. If no known title slug exists, it falls back to case-insensitive path matching. Scrapers do not create `Media` or `MediaTitle` rows.

Path handling for `<game><path>` stays strict:

| Input | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `./relative` or `relative` | Resolved under the system ROM root and rejected if it escapes that root |
| `~/...` | Resolved under the current user's home directory, then rejected unless still under the system ROM root |
| Absolute path | Cleaned and rejected unless under the system ROM root |

Asset path handling for artwork/video/manual uses the same root-bound behavior by default. On MiSTer and MiSTeX only, absolute or `~/...` asset paths may also resolve under platform root directories from `RootDirs(cfg)`, covering SD, USB, CIFS, network, and configured index roots. This applies only to file-backed asset fields; game paths remain bound to the ROM root. Path traversal outside the ROM root or approved platform roots is rejected. The MiSTer arcade set-name fallback below can also interpret a ROM path as an identity without accessing that path; it does not broaden asset access.

Zip-as-directory paths are supported for matching XML entries such as `./Japan/Game.zip` to indexed media stored under that zip path, while nested artwork paths such as `./media/images/Japan/Game.png` remain resolved as asset paths.

Source fields are cleaned before mapping: HTML entities are unescaped, tab/newline/carriage-return characters become spaces, and surrounding whitespace is trimmed.

### Field Mapping

| ES field | Destination | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `lang` | `MediaTags: lang` | CSV split; each code or name mapped with `tags.LookupLanguageWord`, additive |
| `region` | `MediaTags: region` | CSV split; ScreenScraper codes (`wor`, `eur`, `jpn`, `asi`, `sp`) mapped locally, anything else with `tags.LookupRegionWord`; `ss` is not a region and is dropped. Additive |
| `developer` | `MediaTitleTags: developer` | Exclusive |
| `publisher` | `MediaTitleTags: publisher` | Exclusive |
| `releasedate` | `MediaTitleTags: year` | First four characters when present |
| `rating` | `MediaTitleTags: rating` | Normalized from `0..1` style ratings to `0..100` text |
| `genre`, `genreid` | `MediaTitleTags: genre` | Additive. The text goes through the shared ScreenScraper genre table (`scraper/ssgenre`), compound values split and each part mapped, with the parent written beside a subgenre. Recalbox's numeric `genreid` (its `Genres.h` enum) is mapped first when present |
| `players` | `MediaTitleTags: players` | Highest player count from ranges/lists, when it is a listed count |
| `arcadesystemname` | `MediaTitleTags: arcadeboard` | Exclusive, through `tags.LookupArcadeBoard` |
| `family` | `MediaTitleTags: search` | `franchise:<name>`, through `tags.LookupFranchise` |
| `desc` | `MediaTitleProperties: property:description` | Plain text |
| ScreenScraper game ID | `MediaTitleProperties: property:xml-game-id` | From XML attribute or element value |
| `image` | `MediaProperties: property:image-image` | XML path or filesystem fallback |
| `thumbnail` | `MediaProperties: property:image-thumbnail` | Cover/thumbnail path in most ES forks |
| `boxart2d` | `MediaProperties: property:image-boxart` | XML path or filesystem fallback |
| `boxart3d` | `MediaProperties: property:image-boxart3d` | XML path or filesystem fallback |
| `screenshot` | `MediaProperties: property:image-screenshot` | XML path or filesystem fallback |
| `video` | `MediaProperties: property:video` | Filesystem path |
| `marquee` | `MediaProperties: property:image-marquee` | XML path or filesystem fallback |
| `logo` / `wheel` | `MediaProperties: property:image-wheel` | `logo` takes priority over `wheel`; XML path or filesystem fallback |
| `fanart` | `MediaProperties: property:image-fanart` | XML path or filesystem fallback |
| `titlescreen` / `titleshot` | `MediaProperties: property:image-titleshot` | `titlescreen` takes priority over `titleshot`; XML path or filesystem fallback |
| `map` | `MediaProperties: property:image-map` | XML path or filesystem fallback |
| `manual` | `MediaProperties: property:manual` | PDF path |

Filesystem fallback searches known subdirectories under `<systemRootPath>/media/` when an XML path is absent. For games in subfolders, it searches the mirrored ROM-relative path before the flat filename; for example `./Japan/Game.nes` checks `media/images/Japan/Game.png` before `media/images/Game.png`. Side/back box art are filesystem-fallback only.

### Directory Entries

Both `<folder>` entries and `<game>` entries whose `<path>` resolves to a directory are matched to the single media row that directory collapses to, using the same rule browse uses to show a disc folder as one game. A directory qualifies when it has no nested media and its direct contents are one file, one `.m3u` plus its discs, one `.cue` plus its companion tracks, or at least two supported disc-image files that all share one positive `MediaTitleDBID`. Supported shared-title disc extensions are `.cue`, `.chd`, `.iso`, `.bin`, `.img`, and `.pbp`; mixed title IDs or other extensions remain ambiguous.

This covers the two common EmulationStation layouts for multi-disc games: a `<folder>` entry describing a per-game folder, and the ES-DE convention of naming that folder with a ROM extension so it reads as one game and gets an ordinary `<game>` entry.

`<folder>` entries carry a smaller field set than games: `name`, `desc`, `image`, `thumbnail`, `video`, and `marquee`. They are processed after that file's `<game>` entries, so a real game entry pointing at the same media row always wins. Folders that do not collapse are skipped, because there is no row to carry their metadata; ordinary collections stay plain browseable directories.

A directory entry only ever resolves through the container rule, whichever kind it is, so use a `<folder>` entry only for a directory that collapses. A `<game>` entry naming a directory that holds media in subdirectories no longer matches the single row underneath it, because resolving a directory by scanning for indexed paths beneath it is only unambiguous until an earlier entry has claimed one of them, and switching it to a `<folder>` entry does not help: that is skipped for the same reason. For any directory that does not collapse, point the `<game>` entry at the media file itself.

Artwork for a directory entry is looked up under the directory's own name, matching where EmulationStation stores art for a folder it shows as one game. Only a disc extension (`.cue`, `.m3u`, `.chd`, `.iso`, `.bin`, `.img`, `.pbp`) is stripped from that name before the search; any other dot is treated as part of the folder name, so a folder called `Sonic 3.0` does not pick up `Sonic 3`'s artwork.

## media-folder Directory Artwork

For every present indexed media row, `media-folder` considers each ancestor directory below its system ROM root. It searches the usual artwork categories under `<systemRoot>/media/`, first at the mirrored ROM-relative location and then by flat directory basename. For example, directory `RPGs/Final Fantasy VII` checks `media/boxart/RPGs/Final Fantasy VII.png` before `media/boxart/Final Fantasy VII.png`. System root itself is excluded.

Folder artwork does not change browse structure. Arbitrary collections remain `type: "directory"`; only existing container rules add launch metadata. `media.browse` reports `hasCover: true` when a directory image property exists for one of that entry's systems, and `media.image` accepts the directory's `(system, path)` to return it.

Directory properties are collected in memory for one system and committed as a complete snapshot only after all its directories finish. Cancellation or failure before replacement preserves that system's previous snapshot. A completed empty snapshot removes stale directory rows. Rebuilding `BrowseDirs` does not affect these properties because they are keyed by stable system DBID and canonical path rather than browse-cache DBID.

By default, only `<ROM root>/gamelist.xml` files are loaded. Nested files such as `<ROM root>/Japan/gamelist.xml` are not read.

An additional metadata bundle can be configured independently of ROM storage:

```toml
[scraper.gamelist_xml]
custom_path = "/path/to/gamelists"
```

For each indexed system, the scraper also checks `<custom_path>/<system ID>/gamelist.xml`. Game paths in this file resolve against the system's first ROM root; asset paths resolve against the custom system directory. Custom bundle image references are optional: only files present during scraping are stored, and missing references fall back to `media/` artwork under the custom directory and then the system's ROM roots. Run the scraper again after installing more bundle artwork. Regular ROM-root gamelists are processed first and take precedence over matching custom entries.

Custom gamelists enrich existing indexed records; they do not create systems, titles, or media rows. For systems that index virtual or non-file-backed entries (where the stored media path does not correspond to a real file), `<path>` must match the exact path the indexer stored for that media row.

`gamelist.xml` deliberately does not scrape user-state fields such as favorite, hidden, or kidgame. It also does not overwrite filename-parser-owned fields such as disc and track.

## MiSTer Arcade Gamelists

MiSTer indexes launchable `.mra` descriptors under `_Arcade`, not MAME ROM ZIPs. A gamelist authored by Skraper against `pacman.zip` therefore cannot identify `Pac-Man (Midway).mra` by its filesystem path alone.

On MiSTer and MiSTeX, the `gamelist.xml` scraper can bridge these identities using the `<setname>` stored inside each indexed MRA:

- A `<game><path>` ending in `.zip` or `.7z`, or containing a bare set name, supplies the set-name key. Keys are case-insensitive; they contain letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens, up to 128 characters.
- The matching MRA must be live and uniquely identified within the system currently being scraped. Already-scraped MRAs still count when checking uniqueness; force and resume cannot make a duplicate set appear unique.
- Multiple MRAs with the same set name are skipped, including alternate-core variants and duplicates sharing one title. Use an exact MRA path to choose a variant instead of relying on ROM-set matching.
- Entries that name the row directly take precedence: an indexed path, or a slug match the entry's own path confirms. A set name outranks a record that only guessed the row from its title, in either XML order, because arcade clone sets routinely share one display name. Unknown set names retain existing slug matching. A known ambiguous set does not fall back to guessing by title.
- A unique match receives title metadata and media-level artwork. Artwork filename fallback uses the source set name in any supported artwork extension, such as `media/images/pacman.png` or `media/images/pacman.jpg`, rather than the MRA's display filename.

### Exporting A Scraper Bundle

To keep metadata outside `_Arcade`, export or copy the gamelist and its referenced images together into a custom bundle:

```text
/media/fat/metadata/
└── Arcade/
    ├── gamelist.xml
    └── images/
        └── pacman.png
```

```toml
[scraper.gamelist_xml]
custom_path = "/media/fat/metadata"
```

Example `Arcade/gamelist.xml`:

```xml
<gameList>
  <game>
    <path>./pacman.zip</path>
    <name>Pac-Man</name>
    <desc>Metadata exported by your scraper.</desc>
    <image>./images/pacman.png</image>
  </game>
</gameList>
```

Index the MRAs first, then run `gamelist.xml` for `Arcade`. For a granular arcade system such as `CPS1`, use a `CPS1` bundle directory and scrape that indexed system; those systems are classified out of `_Arcade` rather than scanned from a folder of their own, so an installed bundle is what makes them scrapable at all. Existing arcade classification determines system membership; the scraper neither creates MRA entries nor guesses membership from catalog titles.

A gamelist in `_Arcade` also supports these ROM/set-name references. Core does **not** automatically discover `games/mame/gamelist.xml` or arbitrary nested gamelists: put the bundle in the configured layout above, or place a gamelist in a configured ROM root.

Regular set-name entries may retain absolute or sibling ROM ZIP paths from the scraper machine, including Windows paths. Core extracts only the basename identity; it never opens or launches those source ZIP paths. Image, video, and manual references keep the existing asset-root restrictions. Custom images must exist at scrape time. Relative Companion ZIP child references also support unique set-name matching; existing Companion path validation and parent metadata behavior remain unchanged.

Unreadable or malformed MRA descriptors, and those repeating `<setname>` in their header, are not identity sources. Only the descriptor header up to its first `<rom>` element is read, so the embedded ROM payload of a large MRA costs nothing and does not disqualify it. No MRA, ROM archive, or launcher configuration is rewritten. AmigaVision `games.txt` and `demos.txt` integration is separate from arcade matching.

## MiSTer Installed Docs Databases

The MiSTer-only `mister-docs` scraper indexes assets already installed by MiSTer Downloader or Update All. Downloader remains responsible for downloading, verifying, updating, and placing third-party content. Core performs no online database enumeration and does not edit Downloader configuration.

Example artwork sources:

```ini
[chipster6502/artworkdb-snes]
db_url = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chipster6502/artworkdb-nintendo-consoles/db/snes_box2d.json.zip

[chipster6502/artworkdb-genesis]
db_url = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chipster6502/artworkdb-sega/db/genesis_box2d.json.zip

[chipster6502/artworkdb-arcade]
db_url = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chipster6502/artworkdb-arcade/db/arcade_box2d.json.zip
```

Game manuals can be selected through Update All's **Game Manuals (EN)** settings or installed through compatible Downloader database sections. These collections are large; Core intentionally does not mirror or bulk-download them.

### Discovery

Core derives `docs` roots from MiSTer's configured SD, USB, network/CIFS, and custom index roots, and also probes `/media/usb6` and `/media/usb7`, which artwork packs may be installed to but MiSTer's games-folder list does not reach. It recognizes content by installed format rather than repository name, following the [MiSTer Artwork Pack format](https://github.com/chipster6502/MiSTer_artwork_pack/blob/main/PACK_FORMAT.md):

- Artwork: `docs/<System>/Artwork/` holding one `<key>.jpg` per game, normally with an `index.tsv` beside them that maps every known dump to its key. `<System>` is the MiSTer `games/` folder name. A directory with images and no index still resolves games filed under their exact key.
- Optional title metadata: `gameinfo.tsv` beside the images. Games it lists without an image still receive their metadata.
- Optional description: `synopsis_<lang>.tsv` beside the images. Which languages a pack ships varies per system, so Core reads whichever files exist and picks the first match from `media.default_langs`, then English, then the first available language.
- Manuals: direct PDF files in a child directory whose name contains `manual`, for example `docs/SNES/Manuals/` or `docs/NES/Famicom Disk System Manuals/`.

This format-based discovery means future compatible databases need no Core update. Run `mister-docs` again after Downloader installs or updates content. Normal runs rescan installed records idempotently; force runs additionally delete stale box-art/manual properties whose old paths are proven to belong to a discovered MiSTer docs convention.

Metadata files are treated as untrusted input. Core bounds their size and record count, rejects symlink/path escapes and non-regular assets, skips ambiguous matches, and continues past malformed optional sources where possible.

### Matching And Fields

`index.tsv` maps catalogued dump names to artwork keys: No-Intro names for cartridges, Redump names for CD systems, and MAME parent setnames for arcade. Core resolves each pack entry to installed media in the pack format's order, stopping at the first hit:

1. The catalogued name as a media basename, at media scope.
2. For arcade, the `<setname>` inside each installed `.mra`, at media scope. MRA filenames are titles, so the setname is the only handle an arcade key has; Core reads it from the MRA only for systems that have an arcade artwork source.
3. A media basename whose trailing parenthesised tag is itself a pack key, such as `Shock Troopers (set 1) (shocktro)`, at media scope.
4. A unique bare-title match, at title scope. This step is skipped when the stripped title is not unique among the pack's keys or among the library's titles, and it is only available to index rows: images the index does not mention resolve by exact name alone.

CRC and size columns are not used because hashing every installed ROM would impose substantial MiSTer I/O; the pack format treats that step as optional.

| Source | Destination |
|---|---|
| Artwork image | `property:image-boxart` at media scope for exact matches, title scope for unique slug fallback |
| `gameinfo.tsv` year | title tag `year` |
| `gameinfo.tsv` genre | title tags `genre`, through the shared ScreenScraper genre table; a hierarchy such as `Shoot'em Up / Vertical` writes both `shmup:v` and `shmup` |
| `gameinfo.tsv` developer | title tag `developer` |
| `gameinfo.tsv` players | title tag `players` using highest numeric value, when it is a listed count |
| `synopsis_<lang>.tsv` synopsis | title property `property:description` |
| Manual PDF | title property `property:manual` |

Manual filenames are matched with the same game-title slug normalization used by MediaDB, including leading/trailing article handling. Basenames with no matching title, or whose slug collision remains ambiguous after normalized-name matching, are left unmatched. Category-like names such as system manuals, overlays, or charts are not filtered separately.

Base-system sources enrich their variants, such as SNES MSU-1, Genesis MSU, and the granular arcade systems. On top of that, Core applies the pack format's shared-catalogue rules: Game Boy and Game Boy Color each fall back to the other, Super Game Boy reads both, and FDS falls back to NES but never the reverse. Systems the pack catalogues separately do not fill each other's gaps, so SG-1000 never receives ColecoVision art and Neo Geo Pocket Color never receives Neo Geo Pocket art, even though the general system fallbacks allow it.

If multiple docs roots provide the same property, MiSTer root order decides which source wins. As with other scrapers, running a different scraper later may replace exclusive tags or same-type properties.

## ZaparooCompanion Entries

`gamelist.xml` has a special path for entries marked with `source="ZaparooCompanion"` as either a `source` attribute or `<source>` element.

Companion records are split into:

- Parent entries: have an ID attribute and no path. They carry shared title metadata.
- Child entries: have `parentid` and path. They reference parent metadata.

Child matching:

- Paths ending in `.slug` match an existing title by slug, then use the first Media row for that title as the write target.
- Other child paths first try an exact case-insensitive media path lookup.
- If exact lookup fails, the scraper falls back to filename suffix matching with `FindMediaBySystemAndPathSuffix`.
- Ambiguous suffix matches are skipped instead of updating multiple same-basename media rows.

For matched children, parent metadata is written onto the child title, child `region` and `lang` are written to the child Media row as media-level tags, and the scraper sentinel is written to that child Media row. These writes use `ApplyScrapeResult`, so title metadata, child tags, and the sentinel are committed together.

Current caveats:

- Companion processing still runs before normal title filtering.
- With `force=false`, child media rows that already have the `scraper.gamelist.xml:scraped` sentinel are skipped.
- Companion processed/matched/skipped counts contribute to run counters, but companion entries do not have a separate total in status updates.

These caveats document current behavior, not necessarily desired long-term behavior.

## API Surface

JSON-RPC methods:

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scrapers` | Lists registered scrapers with ID, name, and supported systems |
| `media.scrape` | Starts a scraper run as a background operation |
| `media.scrape.status` | Returns latest in-memory scraper status plus current DB scraped count |
| `media.scrape.cancel` | Cancels the active scraper run |
| `media.scrape.resume` | Resumes a paused scraper run |
| `media.meta` | Returns tags and metadata-only properties for one or more media rows and their titles |
| `media.image` | Returns the best matching image property as base64 data for one media row, including thumbnail art |
| `media.clean.orphans` | Removes missing media rows and orphaned related data |

`media.scrape` params:

```json
{
  "scraperId": "gamelist.xml",
  "systems": ["snes", "nes"],
  "force": false
}
```

Progress is queryable with `media.scrape.status` and broadcast as `media.scraping` notifications:

```json
{
  "scraperId": "gamelist.xml",
  "systemId": "snes",
  "processed": 42,
  "total": 100,
  "matched": 38,
  "skipped": 4,
  "totalScraped": 1000,
  "scraping": true,
  "done": false,
  "paused": false,
  "state": "running",
  "totalSteps": 2,
  "currentStep": 1,
  "currentStepDisplay": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System",
  "currentSystem": {
    "systemId": "snes",
    "systemName": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System",
    "processed": 42,
    "total": 100,
    "matched": 38,
    "skipped": 4
  }
}
```

`totalScraped` is derived from scraper sentinel tags in the database, not from the current run's `matched` count. Existing flat fields stay for compatibility; new UIs should use `currentSystem` for current-system progress and `totalSteps`/`currentStep`/`currentStepDisplay` for whole-run system-step progress.

Only one scraper can run at a time, and scraping is mutually exclusive with media indexing.

`media.meta` returns the metadata graph for media rows: media-level tags and properties, title-level tags and properties, and stored system identity. Single requests accept `mediaId` or `system`/`path` and keep the single-response shape; batch requests use `items` and return per-item results. Binary property bytes are not included; clients should use `media.image` for image data. A `system`/`path` request for a directory resolves only when its direct contents collapse to one logical launch target, which also covers zip containers on platforms that treat zips as directories.

`media.image` accepts one media ref plus image type preferences such as `image`, `boxart`, `boxart3d`, `screenshot`, `wheel`, `titleshot`, `map`, `marquee`, and `fanart`. These resolve to canonical image property tags; for example `boxart` becomes `property:image-boxart` and `image` becomes `property:image-image`. Media-level properties are preferred over title-level properties for the same type. On platforms that treat zips as directories, zip container aliases are checked as media-level fallbacks, so artwork attached to a direct single-game target or its zip can be found from either path. For stale image properties in these canonical tags, such as missing file paths for `property:image-boxart` or `property:image-image`, `media.image` logs the stale property in memory only and does not delete DB rows; lookup falls through to the next available source.

## Useful Focused Tests

```bash
go test ./pkg/database/scraper/...
go test ./pkg/database/mediadb/ -run 'Scrape|Property|Blob|Sentinel|MediaImage'
go test ./pkg/api/methods/ -run 'Scrape|MediaImage|MediaMeta'
go test ./pkg/platforms/mister/ -run 'Arcade'
```

## MiSTer Arcade Catalog Behavior

MiSTer and MiSTeX download, verify and cache the upstream
[`MiSTer-devel/ArcadeDatabase_MiSTer`](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/ArcadeDatabase_MiSTer) catalog under Core's
`assets` directory, and ARM builds embed a copy as a fallback. `mister-arcade` reads that catalog and joins it to
indexed `.mra` rows.

An MRA filename is a display title, so the join key is the `<setname>` inside the descriptor. MiSTer already reads
every set name while classifying granular arcade systems and keeps the result in a size/mtime-validated cache, so
the platform hands the scraper a lookup into that cache and only descriptors it cannot answer are read. MiSTeX has
no granular classification, so every descriptor it indexes is an `Arcade` row and is read on demand. Reads are
bounded to the descriptor header and stop at the ROM payload, so a multi-megabyte MRA costs nothing.

The scraper is registered for `Arcade` and, on MiSTer, for each granular arcade system. It binds those launchers
with `AutoScrapeLaunchers`, so an index that walked `_Arcade` queues a fill-missing job without any user action. A
missing or unreadable catalog fails the run rather than writing an empty result; because fill-missing runs
reconsider rows carrying the permanent sentinel, a later index fills them once the catalog is cached.

A descriptor whose set name the catalog does not list is counted as skipped. The catalog omits hundreds of sets,
nearly all of them under `_Arcade/_alternatives`.

### Field Mapping

Shared facts about the game go to the title, so every regional variant carries them. Facts about the individual
romset go to the media row.

| Catalog column | Destination | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `year` | `MediaTitleTags: year` | Exclusive; four digits only |
| `manufacturer` | `MediaTitleTags: developer` | Exclusive, company-name normalized. `credit` is the union query type, so a value written to `developer` answers both `developer:` and `credit:` filters |
| `category` | `MediaTitleTags: genre` | Additive; mapped by a table covering every category in the bundled catalog, with the parent beside a subgenre (`Shooter - Flying Vertical` → `shmup:v`, `shmup`) |
| `series`, `parent_title` | `MediaTitleTags: search` | `franchise:<name>` through `tags.LookupFranchise`; `parent_title` is used only for a game with no series and only when it names a listed franchise |
| `platform` | `MediaTitleTags: arcadeboard` | Exclusive, through `tags.LookupArcadeBoard` |
| `players` | `MediaTitleTags: players` | Additive; a range writes every listed count in it, plus `simultaneous` or `alt` |
| `move_inputs`, `special_controls` | `MediaTitleTags: input` | Additive; normalized through a fixed phrase table |
| `num_buttons` | `MediaTitleTags: input` as `buttons:N` | Zero buttons writes nothing; a count the input list lacks is dropped |
| `resolution` | `MediaTitleTags: video` as `15khz`/`31khz` | |
| `rotation` | `MediaTitleTags: search` as `tate:cw`/`tate:ccw` | A horizontal monitor is the default and writes nothing |
| `flip` | `MediaTitleTags: search` as `keyword:flip` | |
| `homebrew` | `MediaTitleTags: release` as `homebrew` | |
| `setname` | `MediaProperties: property:mame-setname` | The romset identity, so callers need not re-read descriptors |
| `region` | `MediaTags: region` | Additive; multi-region cells split. A cell reading `bootleg` states a provenance and becomes `unlicensed:bootleg` |
| `version` | `MediaTags`, routed | `YYMMDD` → `builddate`; `Rev A` → `rev:a`; `Set 1` → `set:1`; `Prototype` → `unfinished:proto`; `bootleg`/`hack` → `unlicensed`; a protection chip family → `protection` |
| `alternative` | `MediaTags: alt` | |
| `bootleg` | `MediaTags: unlicensed` as `bootleg` | |

The catalog's `name` is not imported: arcade titles come from the descriptor filename, which the indexer owns.
`linebreak1` and `linebreak2` are upstream layout spacers and are always empty.

Catalog text is treated as untrusted: values are HTML-unescaped, whitespace-collapsed, and checked against the
several spellings upstream uses for "not applicable". The control columns are free text with inconsistent case and
two separators; each phrase the catalog uses is listed explicitly. A phrase that names a control family without the
detail its canonical value needs — a `2-way` joystick with no axis, a bare `stick`, `positional` with no position
count — is logged at debug and dropped rather than resolved to the nearest guess.

Every category, platform and series value in the catalog either maps onto the tag vocabulary or sits in an
explicit, commented skip set in `misterarcade/vocabulary.go` (a BIOS entry, a CPU name rather than a board, a
licence line rather than a series). The catalog itself is downloaded at build time from a moving upstream, so the
coverage tests read a pinned snapshot of its distinct values, `misterarcade/testdata/arcade_catalog_values.tsv`,
and fail on any value that is in neither, and on any skip entry that has since become mappable. When upstream adds
values, devices drop them and name them in the scraper's unmapped-values log line; refreshing the snapshot from the
new catalog makes the tests list exactly what needs curating. Board names map through `tags.LookupArcadeBoard`, which the
`gamelist.xml` scraper shares, so both sources agree on `capcom:cps2` however they spell it.

Writing media-level tags of scanner-owned types changes the `MediaIdentity` fingerprint for rows that lacked them,
as `gamelist.xml`'s media-level `region`/`lang` writes already do. `property:mame-setname` is not scanner-owned and
never affects it.

How much a fill-missing run changes depends on the type. An **exclusive** type is written only when the row has no
value of that type at all, so the MRA filename parser's build date, revision and bootleg normally stand. An
**additive** type is always written, so a row can gain a second value of a type it already had. The two that move
in practice:

- `alt` is new to most rows. The catalog marks a majority of its romsets as alternates and an MRA filename almost
  never says so, so a first run re-fingerprints the bulk of an arcade library — measured against a real `_Arcade`
  corpus, 1748 of 3274 rows, of which 5 had a filename that already said `alt`.
- `region` is additive, so a row whose filename states a territory can gain the catalog's broader value beside it.
  On the same corpus 43 rows ended up carrying `world` next to a specific territory, because the catalog describes
  the romset's release while the filename describes which dump this is.

## PinUP Popper Behavior

The PinUP Popper launcher indexes tables as `popper://<GameID>/<name>` virtual paths, so the scraper needs no name matching: it reads the Popper library once, resolves each `Pinball` media row's GameID to its `Games` row and emulator, and writes the result. Rows already carrying `scraper.pinup-popper:scraped` are left out unless the scrape is forced; rows whose GameID no longer exists in Popper are counted as skipped. Images are looked up as `<Emulators.DirMedia>\<screen>\<GameName>.<png|jpg|jpeg>`, falling back to `POPMedia\<EmuName>` when the emulator has no media directory. Videos, audio and the remaining screens are not imported.

| Popper field | Destination | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GameYear` | `MediaTitleTags: year` | Exclusive, when greater than zero |
| `Manufact` | `MediaTitleTags: developer` | Exclusive, company-name normalized |
| `NumPlayers` | `MediaTitleTags: players` | When it is a listed count |
| (every table) | `MediaTitleTags: genre` | `parlor:pinball` and `parlor`: every Popper table is a pinball table |
| `GameTheme` | `MediaTitleTags: search` | `feature:<name>` only when a theme names a listed feature exactly; other themes are dropped |
| `GameType`, `Category` | not imported | Table technology and Popper's own grouping, not genres |
| `Notes` | `MediaTitleProperties: description` | Whitespace collapsed |
| `Wheel` image | `MediaProperties: image-wheel` | |
| `PlayField` image | `MediaProperties: image-screenshot` | |
| `BackGlass` image | `MediaProperties: image-marquee` | The backglass is the pinball counterpart of a marquee |
| `GameInfo` image | `MediaProperties: image-image` | Flyer or info card |

### Frontend Ownership Boundary

Popper uses one application-local `pinup.Integration` object for launch attempts, process observations and worker shutdown. Windows supplies that object through existing `Launcher.Scanner`, `Launch`, `Kill`, availability and startup/shutdown hooks. Registration does not start Popper or polling workers. This is the pattern for later frontend integrations: keep mutable state local and connect existing callbacks, rather than requiring a shared lifecycle framework.

Table stop uses Popper's frontend exit command and bounded observation/retries, including its loading period. Core does not take ownership of a foreign emulator process for generic child reaping or tree killing. Popper does not provide a session-fenced stop token: an external frontend replacement can race an unconditional exit request. Local attempt guards prevent stale Core retries/publications but cannot make that frontend protocol globally atomic.
