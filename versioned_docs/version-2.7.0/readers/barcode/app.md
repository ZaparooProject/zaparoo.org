# App-Based Scanner

Scan barcodes and QR codes using your phone's camera with the [Zaparoo App](../../app/index.md). This uses the app's launcher feature, which requires a one-time purchase to enable.

See the [QR Codes](../../tokens/qr-codes.md) page for more information on creating and using QR codes with Zaparoo.
