title: "File Manager"

From the ZapEsp32 Web UI, click the `FILE MANAGER` menu item, which will open in a new Tab/Window.
  
Use the File Manager to upload & delete mp3 audio files, or lookup file names for audio clips.  
Keep file names short and avoid more than one `.` in the file name (due to ESP32 limitations).
