# OTA update runbook

How a release reaches the updater, and how to stop it if something is wrong.

Publishing a GitHub release does **not** publish an update. The two are
deliberately separate: a release can sit on GitHub for as long as it takes to
gain confidence in it, and only an explicit workflow dispatch makes devices
aware of it.

## What is published

Four files live at `https://updates.zaparoo.org/ZaparooProject/zaparoo-core/`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `manifest.yaml` | The list of installable releases, their channels, rollouts and per-asset digests |
| `manifest.yaml.sig` | Detached ed25519 signature over `manifest.yaml` |
| `checksums.txt` | `sha256sum`-format digests, derived from the manifest so the two cannot disagree |
| `checksums.txt.sig` | Detached ed25519 signature over `checksums.txt` |

Release archives themselves are served from GitHub, never from the CDN. The
manifest only ever points at `https://github.com/ZaparooProject/zaparoo-core/releases/download/...`,
and the publish workflow refuses to upload a manifest that says otherwise.

The manifest carries a `generation` counter that only ever increases; a device
that has seen generation 412 rejects 411 as a replay. There is no expiry field
and nothing re-signs on a schedule, so a device never needs a working clock to
accept a manifest — which matters on MiSTer, where there is no RTC.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Environment | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OTA validate** | Every published release | none | Read-only. Checks the release would promote cleanly. Publishes nothing. |
| **OTA promote** | Manual | `ota-publish` | Adds a release to the manifest. |
| **OTA rollout** | Manual | `ota-publish` | Changes one release's rollout percentage. |
| **OTA withdraw** | Manual | `ota-publish` | Removes a release from the manifest entirely. |

All three publishing workflows share one concurrency group, so they queue behind
each other rather than racing for the manifest.

There is deliberately no scheduled workflow. Every run that touches the signing
key passes a required reviewer, which keeps the trust base to one environment
and removes a cron as something that can silently fail.

### Promoting a release

1. Wait for **OTA validate** to pass on the release. Its job summary lists the
   inputs to use. A failure here means the release is not promotable at all —
   usually a platform archive missing from the build matrix.
2. Dispatch **OTA promote** with `dry_run: true`. It produces the exact signed
   metadata it would publish and attaches it as an artifact. Nothing reaches
   the CDN.
3. Check the artifact, then dispatch again with `dry_run: false`.

Promote downloads every archive to the runner and hashes it there. GitHub's
reported digests are cross-checked against those hashes in both directions, but
what gets signed is always the bytes on disk.

The first promote is different. The manifest currently live predates signing, so
there is no `manifest.yaml.sig` to verify and no `generation` to advance from.
Publishing on top of an unsigned manifest is refused by default — a stripped
signature would otherwise rewind the counter and stall updates for every device
holding a watermark. To bootstrap, dispatch that one promote with
`generation_floor` set above any generation already published (0 has never been
published, so any positive value works). Every promote after it verifies a
signature and needs no floor.

Start a significant release at a partial `rollout` — 5, then 25, then 100 over a
few days — and widen it with **OTA rollout**. Bucketing is salted per release,
so widening keeps the devices already on it and a different release picks a
fresh, uncorrelated cohort. No device is permanently a guinea pig.

`min_upgrade_from` sets a floor on the version a device must *already* be
running to install this release directly. Use it when a release is only safe as
a step up from a recent version — devices below the floor will not be offered
it and will have to take an intermediate release first. Leave it empty
otherwise; a floor set without that specific reason just strands old installs.

### Something is wrong with a release

Escalate in this order. Each rung is faster and less disruptive than the next.

1. **Halt the rollout.** Dispatch **OTA rollout** with `rollout: 0`. Automatic
   installation stops within one device check interval. The release stays
   installable on request, which is the right call while it is still unclear
   whether the report is one bad device. This is fast — no archives are
   downloaded, one number changes.
2. **Withdraw the release.** Dispatch **OTA withdraw**. The release leaves the
   manifest and its digests leave `checksums.txt`, so it stops being an
   installable target for automatic *and* manual updates. Target: under five
   minutes from decision to verified.
3. **Promote a fix** at `rollout: 100`, with no `min_upgrade_from`, so every
   device is offered it — including the ones sitting on the withdrawn version.

Withdrawing does not roll anything back. Devices that already updated stay on
that version; only the fix in step 3 moves them.

### A Windows device has no executable to start

Windows cannot overwrite a running binary, so installing over one is two
renames: the outgoing binary moves to a sibling name, then the new one takes the
name it left. Between them the install path holds nothing, and Windows starts
Core only from that path — so a device interrupted in that window has nothing
left to launch and never reaches the startup watchdog that would recover it.

Both renames are retried. If the new-file move fails, the updater retries
restoring the outgoing binary. Manual recovery is needed only if both moves
fail, or if power loss or process termination interrupts the gap between them.
External locks are ordinary transient rename failures; the updater does not
lock the install directory.

Before changing any sidecar, stop Core and its service. After a logged double
failure, Core may still be running from the mapped `superseded` file even though
the normal install path is empty.

When the error was logged, use its exact `target` and `superseded` paths; the
executable may not be named `zaparoo.exe`:

```text
ERR binary swap left the install path empty; rename the superseded binary back
to the target path to recover target=... superseded=...
```

A power loss in the gap cannot write that log entry. Sidecar names are derived
from the target in the same directory, so inspect hidden files there. For a
target named `zaparoo.exe`:

- `zaparoo.zaparoo-update-old.exe` (or `-old-1`, `-old-2`, up to `-old-7`) is an
  outgoing binary moved aside by a swap. Use the newest slot belonging to the
  interrupted attempt when that can be identified.
- `zaparoo.zaparoo-update-backup.exe` is the durable copy of the outgoing binary.
  If no unambiguous `-old` slot exists, copy this backup to the empty target.
- `zaparoo.zaparoo-update-new.exe` is the verified candidate, not the recovery
  source.

With Core stopped, rename the logged or identified `-old` file to the target,
or copy the backup there, then start the service. That restores the version the
device was already running; the pending update is unwound on the next start.
Never put the `-new` file in place by hand: the durable marker still records an
interrupted install, so recovery must restore the known-good outgoing binary.

## Setup

### Secrets and environments

The signing key and the CDN credentials live on GitHub Environments, not on the
repository, so a workflow file alone cannot reach them.

`ota-publish` is the only one, and it has **required reviewers configured.**
Used by promote, rollout and withdraw. Holds:

- `UPDATE_SIGNING_KEY` — PEM-encoded ed25519 private key
- `BUNNY_STORAGE_ZONE`, `BUNNY_STORAGE_ZONE_PASSWORD`
- `BUNNY_API_KEY`, `BUNNY_PULL_ZONE_ID`

Every path to the signing key therefore goes through a human. What stops that
being circumvented by editing a workflow is CODEOWNERS:
`.github/workflows/ota-*.yml`, `.github/actions/ota-metadata/` and
`scripts/generate-update-manifest/` are owned by `@ZaparooProject/admins`.
Changing any of them needs the same review as changing the signing key. So is
`pkg/service/updater/otameta/keys/`, because adding a file there makes every
device trust manifests signed with that key.

### CDN edge rule

Release archives are served from GitHub, not from Bunny, so the pull zone has
an edge rule that redirects requests on to GitHub releases. The four metadata
files are the exception and must be served from the storage zone:
`manifest.yaml`, `manifest.yaml.sig`, `checksums.txt` and `checksums.txt.sig`.

If a metadata file is not exempted from that rule it still uploads to storage
perfectly well, and then the public URL answers with a 302 to a GitHub release
asset that does not exist. The publish succeeds and step 8 below fails,
reporting that the edge is serving older metadata — which is misleading, since
what actually came back was a redirect page rather than stale bytes. Anything
added to the publish set needs the edge rule updated first.

### Key rotation

Public keys are embedded in the client from
`pkg/service/updater/otameta/keys/`, one bare base64 key per file, named for its
key id — `k1.pub` is key id `k1`. The manifest names the key it was signed with
in `key_id`, and an unknown `key_id` is a hard reject: clients do not try every
key, because that would defeat revocation.

Publishing builds its verification key from the same directory, so a `key-id`
with no matching `.pub` file fails the run before the signing key is loaded
rather than publishing a manifest no device trusts.

To rotate: add the new `.pub` file and ship a release embedding both keys, wait
for it to reach the fleet, then change the `key-id` input default in
`.github/actions/ota-metadata/action.yml` and swap the signing secret. Devices
that never took the intermediate release stop updating rather than accepting an
unknown key, so do not rush the middle step. Removing an old key from the
directory is what revokes it, and should be a separate later release.

## How a publish is verified

Every publishing run does the same thing, in this order:

1. Read the live metadata from the Bunny **storage origin**, not the CDN. A
   stale edge response would hand us an old generation, and republishing a
   generation devices have already seen stalls updates for everyone holding
   that watermark.
2. Verify the live signatures before trusting anything in them.
3. Apply exactly one change, and stamp a generation strictly greater than the
   live one.
4. Run the client's own asset selection over the generated manifest, for every
   platform and architecture the build produces. Two archives a device could
   both install fails anywhere in the manifest; a missing archive fails on the
   newest release in each channel, which is the one devices are offered. This
   runs before the signing key is loaded.
5. Sign both documents and verify those signatures locally.
6. Check the publish directory holds those four files and nothing else, and
   that no archive URL points anywhere but GitHub.
7. Upload and purge the pull zone.
8. Re-fetch all four files from the public URL — the plain URL a device would
   request, through the edge cache — and require them to be byte-identical to
   what was signed. Cache-busting is deliberately not used: the thing being
   checked is what the edge serves, and bypassing the cache would verify the
   storage origin instead and miss the case that matters. Step 7's purge is what
   makes the edge current, so a mismatch here means the purge has not landed
   yet, and the step retries for a while because propagation is not instant.
   Each failed attempt logs the `Cdn-Cache` header per file: a `HIT` means the
   purge did not take, a `MISS` means the origin itself is serving something
   other than what was uploaded. **A run that reaches this step and fails it has
   published something unverified** — investigate before dispatching anything
   else.

The signed metadata is attached as a build artifact on every run, dry or not,
and kept for 90 days.

## Retention

The manifest keeps the newest five stable and five beta releases. Older entries
are pruned from the manifest *and* from `checksums.txt` on every promote — if
they were only pruned from one, a dropped release would stay installable
through the other. Release notes for superseded releases are truncated; the
newest release in each channel always keeps its full notes.
