# Barcode Scanners

Zaparoo supports reading barcodes and QR codes through two methods:

## App-Based Scanning

Use your phone's camera to scan barcodes and QR codes with the [Zaparoo App](../../app/index.md). This is the easiest option if you already have the app.

- No additional hardware required
- Works with any barcode or QR code
- Requires app launcher feature (one-time purchase)

See [App-Based Scanner](./app.md) for details.

## Hardware Scanners

Connect a physical barcode scanner via serial port (RS232) for hands-free scanning. Great for dedicated setups and supports both linear barcodes and QR codes.

- Requires RS232 barcode scanner hardware
- Hands-free operation
- Fast and reliable

See [RS232 Scanner](./rs232.md) for setup and usage.
