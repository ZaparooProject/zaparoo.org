## New Platform Support

### Bazzite and ChimeraOS

Zaparoo now officially supports [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/) and [ChimeraOS](https://chimeraos.org/), two popular gaming-focused Linux distributions. Both are designed for Steam Deck, gaming handhelds, and desktop gaming PCs. Release builds are now available for both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures.

### EmuDeck and RetroDECK on SteamOS

Steam Deck users can now launch games directly through [EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com/) or [RetroDECK](https://retrodeck.net/). Tap a token and your game launches through your preferred emulator frontend. Gaming Mode is fully supported with proper window focus management.

## Steam Integration

### Automatic Game Detection

Zaparoo now detects when you start Steam games externally (not through Zaparoo). Whether you launch a game from Steam Big Picture mode or the desktop client, it shows up in ActiveMedia with its proper name. This works on Linux, SteamOS, Bazzite, ChimeraOS, Windows, and macOS.

### Game Details Action

A new `action` option lets you open Steam's game details page instead of launching directly. Use `?action=details` in your ZapScript or set it as the default in your launcher config. Great for showcasing your game collection or checking achievements before playing.

### macOS Support

Steam integration now works on macOS, automatically detecting your Steam installation and launching games.

## mDNS Network Discovery

Zaparoo now advertises itself on your local network using mDNS. Mobile apps and other clients can automatically find and connect to your Zaparoo instance without needing to enter IP addresses manually. Access Zaparoo using friendly `.local` addresses like `http://mister.local:7497`.

```toml
[service.discovery]
enabled = true              # Enabled by default
instance_name = "MyZaparoo" # Optional custom name
```

## Blocking Hooks

Three hooks can now block actions by returning an error: `on_scan`, `on_remove`, and the new `before_media_start`. Scripts executed via `**execute:` now receive a `ZAPAROO_ENVIRONMENT` JSON variable with full system state.

```toml
[launchers]
before_media_start = "**execute:/path/to/script.sh"
```

Your script gets access to the current platform, active media, scanned token, and launching media details. Exit with an error to prevent the action.

## MiSTer Improvements

### Flexible Core Locations

Zaparoo now scans for FPGA cores and builds a cache on startup. Cores can be installed anywhere, not just default directories. User-specific directories and alternative folder structures are now supported automatically.

### System ID Aliases in Config

Configuration options like `[[systems.default]]` and `ignore_system` now support fuzzy matching with aliases. Use `megadrive`, `N64`, or `playstation` instead of memorizing exact system IDs.

### Neo Geo Fixes

Fixed issues where files inside Neo Geo zip archives or extracted game folders were incorrectly indexed as separate games. The scanner now correctly recognizes game containers and only shows each game once.

### Alt-Core Path Fixes

Fixed RBF paths for the 80MHz N64 and 2X PSX alternative cores.

## ZapLink Improvements

### Platform Detection Headers

ZapLink servers now receive headers identifying your device's OS, architecture, and platform. Servers can serve different scripts for different devices from the same URL.

### Faster First Scans

Known ZapLink hosts are pre-warmed in the background when Zaparoo starts, eliminating delay from DNS lookups and TLS handshakes on your first scan.

### Automatic Re-checking

Websites that didn't support ZapLinks are automatically re-checked after 30 days.

## Reader Improvements

### Sleep/Wake Reconnection

USB readers now automatically reconnect after your system wakes from sleep. No more manual intervention needed after closing your laptop lid.

### External Drive Reader Fixes

Fixed stale mount detection for external drive readers, ensuring safer mount/unmount operations.

### Better NFC Diagnostics

NDEF tag reading failures now produce visible warnings without needing debug mode, making it easier to troubleshoot NFC sticker issues.

## API Improvements

### Notification Inbox

A new persistent inbox system stores notifications that survive restarts. Messages can have severity levels (info, warning, error) and are broadcast in real-time via WebSocket. New API methods: `inbox`, `inbox.delete`, `inbox.clear`.

### Centralized Validation

All API parameters are now validated consistently with clear, human-readable error messages. Invalid launchers, systems, or durations are caught early with helpful feedback.

### Root URL Redirect

Navigating to the server root now redirects to `/app/` automatically.

## Internal Improvements

- Linux platform code refactored into a shared base, reducing duplication across SteamOS, Bazzite, and ChimeraOS
- Steam code consolidated into a unified package with platform-specific implementations
- Type-safe advanced arguments for ZapScript with built-in validation
- Fuzz testing added for ZapScript parsers
- Improved process lifecycle tracking prevents zombie processes
- Better media indexing diagnostics with timing information
