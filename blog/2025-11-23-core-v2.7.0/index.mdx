Zaparoo Core v2.7.0 is now available! This is a massive release with some fundamental improvements to how Zaparoo works. Title IDs are now the default way to identify games, making your tokens portable between devices and platforms. We've also added a powerful tags system, completely overhauled the media database for better performance, added playtime limits for parental controls, full Linux desktop support, and a ton of platform-specific improvements across MiSTer, Windows, and Batocera.

{/* truncate */}

Before I dive in, huge thanks to [PigSaint](https://github.com/PigSaint) whose [GameDatabase](https://github.com/PigSaint/GameDataBase) project was a big inspiration for the tags system, and [BossRighteous](https://github.com/BossRighteous) who continues to contribute great ideas to the project.

:::info Upgrading from v2.6.x
Your existing cards will keep working - no need to rewrite them. After upgrading, you'll need to manually trigger a media database update to get all the new features working.
:::

:::info App Update Coming Soon

The Zaparoo App is still being updated to fully support this release. The current published app will work but won't have the new features yet - card writing uses full paths instead of title IDs, and search is capped at 100 results. The Web UI bundled with this release has most of the new stuff working. A full app update plus a Core hotfix with the latest Web UI will be out in the next couple weeks.

## Title IDs - The New Default

The biggest change in this release is how Zaparoo identifies games. Instead of writing file paths to your tokens, the default format is now **[title IDs](/docs/zapscript/launch/#title-id)** like `@Genesis/Sonic Spinball` or `@SNES/Super Mario World`.

```
Old way: /media/fat/games/Genesis/Sonic Spinball.bin
New way: @Genesis/Sonic Spinball
```

This change means your tokens will now work between different Zaparoo devices and platforms! Write a card on your MiSTer, scan it on your Windows PC, and it'll launch the same game. The system automatically matches the title to whatever media you have locally.

The old path-based format still works, so your existing cards won't break. But going forward, title IDs are the way.

:::note Web UI Only
Writing title IDs to cards is currently only supported in the bundled Web UI. The published app still writes full file paths.
:::

## [Tags System](/docs/core/tags/)

Tags are the other half of the new game matching system. As media is indexed, Zaparoo now extracts and assigns [tags](/docs/core/tags/) from filenames (and eventually scraped metadata). You can use these tags to filter searches and resolve conflicts.

For example: `@SNES/Super Mario World (region:eu) (lang:de)` will specifically launch the European German version if you have multiple versions of the game. Tags currently include language, region, translation status, release year, ROM quality, and game version info.

:::note Web UI Only
Tag filtering in search is currently only available in the bundled Web UI.

## Media Database Improvements

The media database got some serious upgrades:

- **System-specific updates**: You can now update just one system instead of your entire library, making updates much faster when you only changed a few games _(Web UI only)_
- **Cancelable updates**: Stop an in-progress update whenever you want _(Web UI only)_
- **Crash-resistant**: Unplug mid-update? No problem. Core picks up right where it left off next time
- **Background optimization**: The main update finishes faster, with optimization happening in the background so you can start searching and launching sooner
- **Blazing fast search**: Searching is now basically instant, even with tons of filters applied
- **Pagination**: No more hard limit of 250 results. The Web UI now supports infinite scrolling through search results _(published app still capped at 100)_

## [MiSTer Improvements](/docs/platforms/mister/)

MiSTer gets a lot of love this release:

- **[Video playback overhaul](/docs/platforms/mister/#video)**: We've switched to nextfvp for much better video playback. [Download it here](https://zaparoo.org/files/fvp-mister_arm-15ea265.zip), extract `fvp` to your `linux` folder, create a `Video` folder in games, add your videos, update the DB, and you're done
- **[ScummVM support](/docs/platforms/mister/#scummvm)**: Full support for ScummVM using the [bbond007 script](https://github.com/bbond007/MiSTer_ScummVM). Install it, add your games, update the DB, done
- **Neo Geo Pocket/Color support**: Both systems now fully supported
- **Atari 5200 fixes**: Some missing file extensions have been added
- **Log viewing**: View and download logs directly from the TUI

## [Linux Desktop Platform Support](/docs/platforms/linux/)

Initial [Linux desktop platform](/docs/platforms/linux/) support is here! This includes:

- Installer with desktop integration
- systemd service support
- Hardware setup utilities
- Steam launcher integration for launching PC games
- URL launching in web browsers

This new platform will serve as a foundation for improving existing platforms like SteamOS and supporting new ones like ChimeraOS in future releases.

## [Windows](/docs/platforms/windows/) & LaunchBox Improvements

Windows users get some great updates:

- **[LaunchBox overhaul](/docs/platforms/windows/#launchbox)**: Complete rewrite of LaunchBox integration with a new plugin system for more reliable launching and active game tracking
- **RetroBat fixes**: Now works correctly with proper API integration
- **Steam improvements**: Non-Steam games and shortcuts are now detected and launched correctly

## [Batocera Enhancements](/docs/platforms/batocera/)

- **[New pacman package](/docs/platforms/batocera/#install-script)**: Much easier installation with a new pacman package, plus a "Ports" script to open the TUI directly from EmulationStation
- **Active media detection**: Background tracking to automatically detect which games are currently running
- **Kodi launching improvements**: Smoother and more reliable launching when using Kodi mode
- **System compatibility fixes**: Corrected file extensions for 22 systems including ports, game engines (quake, doom), and modern consoles (ps3, psvita, switch, wiiu, xbox360)

We're also working with the Batocera team to get Zaparoo Core officially included in the Content Downloader for even easier installation in the future.

## [Playtime Limits & Parental Controls](/docs/core/playtime/)

A new [time management system](/docs/core/playtime/) lets you set daily playtime limits, track gaming sessions, and automatically enforce limits with grace period notifications. Perfect for parents who want to manage screen time.

:::note Web UI Only
Playtime limit configuration is currently only available in the bundled Web UI. You can also manually configure limits in the config file.
:::

## MQTT & External Drive Reader Support

Two really cool new reader types:

- **[MQTT reader](/docs/readers/mqtt/)**: Connect to an MQTT broker (like Home Assistant) and send ZapScript commands directly to Zaparoo
- **[External drive reader](/docs/readers/external-drive/)**: Treat USB sticks and SD cards as tokens! Core auto-detects when a drive is mounted and runs the ZapScript in a `zaparoo.txt` file on it

## Other New Features

### Reader Support

- **[RS232 barcode reader support](/docs/readers/barcode/rs232/)**: New driver for RS232-based barcode scanners
- **[Legacy NFC driver option](/docs/core/drivers/#legacy-nfc-drivers)**: If the new NFC driver isn't working for you, you can now explicitly use the old one with `legacypn532uart` and `legacypn532i2c` driver IDs

### System Improvements

- **[Universal keyboard combo support](/docs/zapscript/input/#inputkeyboard)**: Keyboard combos now work on all platforms (MiSTer, MiSTeX, Batocera, Linux, etc.) instead of just MiSTer
- **Neo Geo split**: Neo Geo AES and MVS are now separate platforms for better organization
- **Scan audio feedback**: Now works on all platforms and reports ZapScript execution errors
- **URL launching**: Open URLs in web browsers from ZapScript on Windows and Linux desktop platforms

### Configuration & Integration

- **Notification publisher**: Publish API notifications to external services like MQTT brokers
- **[API security controls](/docs/core/config/#api_listen)**: Bind the API server to specific network interfaces with [`api_listen`](/docs/core/config/#api_listen), and create IP allowlists with [`allowed_ips`](/docs/core/config/#allowed_ips) (supports individual IPs, CIDR ranges, IPv4/IPv6)
- **[Custom audio files](/docs/core/config/#success_sound)**: Set custom [`success_sound`](/docs/core/config/#success_sound) and [`fail_sound`](/docs/core/config/#fail_sound) in config (supports WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC)
- **[.zaparooignore](/docs/core/config/#media_dirs)**: Place this file in directories to exclude them from media scanning

## ZapScript Improvements

- [`launch.random`](/docs/zapscript/launch/#launchrandom) is significantly faster, especially for systems with tons of games
- [`launch.title`](/docs/zapscript/launch/#launchtitle) command added to launch by title ID
- [`launch`](/docs/zapscript/launch/) command now supports title IDs (though the `@` prefix is recommended)
- [`?system=<id>`](/docs/zapscript/launch/#launch) advanced argument now works for local file paths
- [`**playlist.open`](/docs/zapscript/playlist/#playlistopen) with no arguments reloads the current playlist

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed hold mode quitting when a reader disconnects with an error
- Fixed NFC tags immediately launching after writing (now waits for a real re-scan)
- Fixed I2C reader support with the new NFC driver
- Fixed Artist and Album launching for Kodi
- Scan history in database now auto-cleans old entries
- MiSTer service auto-start issues resolved with improved startup reliability
