## NAS Support (SMB)

Core now has limited support for downloading and installing media from a remote URL! This means if you're running a NAS on your network (like [RetroNAS](https://github.com/retronas/retronas)) you can now reference files directly on a card and Core will automatically download, install and launch the game.

For example, write this to an NFC card:

```
smb://10.0.0.123/Games/path/to/file.bin?system=Genesis
```

Scan it, and the first scan Core will automatically download the file for you and launch it. Once the file is cached on disk, any later scans will prefer to launch the downloaded file instead.

Read the [remote install](/docs/zapscript/launch#remote-install) section of the docs for a full rundown of this feature. It also supports authentication, HTTP links and a configurable install location.
