## New Platform Support

- **[Bazzite](/docs/platforms/bazzite) and [ChimeraOS](/docs/platforms/chimeraos)** beta builds are now available for AMD64 and ARM64. These are gaming-focused Linux distributions for Steam Deck and desktop gaming PCs. Feedback welcome as we work toward stable releases.
- **[EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com/) and [RetroDECK](https://retrodeck.net/)** launcher support on [SteamOS](/docs/platforms/steamos). Gaming Mode support is included but still being tested.

## Steam Integration

- **Automatic game detection** tracks Steam games launched outside of Zaparoo, showing them in ActiveMedia. This is a new feature and we'd appreciate feedback on how it works across different setups.
- **Game details action** opens Steam's game details page instead of launching. Use `?action=details` in [ZapScript](/docs/zapscript/launch) or set it as the launcher default.

## mDNS Network Discovery

Zaparoo now [advertises itself](/docs/core/config#servicediscovery) on your local network using mDNS. Mobile apps and other clients can automatically find and connect to your Zaparoo instance without needing to enter IP addresses manually. Access Zaparoo using friendly `.local` addresses like `http://mister.local:7497`.

```toml
[service.discovery]
enabled = true              # Enabled by default
instance_name = "MyZaparoo" # Optional custom name
```

## Blocking Hooks

Three hooks can now block actions by returning an error: [`on_scan`](/docs/core/config#on_scan), [`on_remove`](/docs/core/config#on_remove), and the new [`before_media_start`](/docs/core/config#before_media_start). Scripts executed via `**execute:` now receive a `ZAPAROO_ENVIRONMENT` JSON variable with full system state.

```toml
[launchers]
before_media_start = "**execute:/path/to/script.sh"
```

Your script gets access to the current platform, active media, scanned token, and launching media details. Exit with an error to prevent the action.

## [MiSTer](/docs/platforms/mister) Improvements

- **Flexible core locations** with automatic scanning and caching. Cores can be installed anywhere, not just default directories.
- **Neo Geo fixes** for files inside zip archives or extracted game folders being incorrectly indexed as separate games.
- **Alt-core path fixes** for the 80MHz N64 and 2X PSX alternative cores.

## [Zap Link](/docs/zapscript/zaplinks) Improvements

- **Platform detection headers** identify your device's OS, architecture, and platform. Servers can serve different scripts for different devices from the same URL.
- **Faster first scans** by pre-warming known hosts in the background when Zaparoo starts.

## [Reader](/docs/readers) Improvements

- **Sleep/wake reconnection** for USB readers after your system wakes from sleep. This is new and may need further testing on different systems.
- **[External drive reader](/docs/readers/external-drive) fixes** for stale mount detection, ensuring safer mount/unmount operations.
- **Better NFC diagnostics** with visible warnings for NDEF tag reading failures without needing debug mode.
- **Clone tag compatibility** improved through upgraded PN532 driver with spec-compliant TLV scanning.

## API Improvements

- **Notification inbox** stores persistent notifications that survive restarts. Messages have severity levels and broadcast in real-time via WebSocket. New methods: `inbox`, `inbox.delete`, `inbox.clear`.
- **Centralized validation** for all API parameters with clear, human-readable error messages.
- **Root URL redirect** to `/app/` automatically.

## Other Changes

- **Windows installers are now signed** which helps avoid SmartScreen warnings. Thanks to [SignPath](https://signpath.io/) for sponsoring the project with free code signing.
- **System ID aliases** in [config](/docs/core/config) options like `[[systems.default]]` and `ignore_system`. Use `megadrive`, `N64`, or `playstation` instead of exact system IDs.
- **[Opt-in error reporting](/docs/core/config#error_reporting)** via Sentry. When enabled, anonymous crash reports help identify and fix bugs. Disabled by default.
- [Zap Link](/docs/zapscript/zaplinks) hosts that don't support the protocol are automatically re-checked after 30 days.
- Launch guard prevents concurrent media launches from causing conflicts
- Linux platform code refactored into a shared base, reducing duplication across SteamOS, Bazzite, and ChimeraOS
- Steam code consolidated into a unified package with platform-specific implementations
- Type-safe advanced arguments for [ZapScript](/docs/zapscript) with built-in validation
- Improved process lifecycle tracking prevents zombie processes
- Better media indexing diagnostics with timing information

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed hold mode not working** due to tag session management bug
- Fixed data race in RS232 barcode reader connection status
- Fixed slice mutation bug in reader auto-detection
- Reduced log noise from auto-detect heartbeat messages
- Fixed romsets.xml parsing for comma-separated name aliases
- Added fallback filter for Neo Geo scanning when romsets.xml is invalid
- Reader connection configuration now properly implies driver enabled
- Reduced Kodi and EmulationStation API logging noise on Batocera
- Service now stops cleanly on API bind failure
- Steam shortcuts.vdf parsing now tolerant of missing optional fields
- Added validation for API port and listen address settings
- Fixed fallback matching for auth credentials lookup
- Transient errors no longer permanently disable Zap Link hosts
- Fixed Batocera pacman package version sanitization
