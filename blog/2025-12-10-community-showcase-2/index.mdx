Welcome back to the community showcase! I've got another batch of awesome creations from our [Discord](https://zaparoo.org/discord) members to share. This time we've got some incredible hardware builds, beautiful card designs, and even some video demos.

## Xander Hunt

  alt="Lazarus Pascal cover tool"
/>

Xander Hunt wrote a custom tool in Lazarus Pascal (huh??) for generating card label images. Always cool to see people building their own software tools for Zaparoo.

  alt="Cards generated with the tool"
/>

And here are some cards generated with that tool.

## Schlarp

Schlarp put together this cool collection of game cards made with the [Zaparoo Designer](https://design.zaparoo.org/).

## tangocat

  alt="Cutting labels"
/>

tangocat shared this nice example of using low cost tools to make quality labels. A corner cutter and some scissors go a long way with labels from the Designer.

## BigBlue709

  alt="Switch case with custom cover"
/>

BigBlue709 is back with another repurposed Nintendo Switch case featuring a custom printed cover insert. These hold NFC cards really well and look great on a shelf.

## Thwonp

    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

Thwonp has done something _sick_ here. They've converted an old Apple Superdrive to have an NFC reader inside. You insert the card into the disc slot! It's connected to an iMac running Batocera. The whole build is incredibly clean.

## kertgartner

<video controls width="100%">
  <source
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/showcase/kertgartner_nes_mini_web.mp4")}
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

kertgartner put NFC tags inside NES Mini carts and is using them to launch games in Batocera. I love this, can't wait to see it complete.

## whtafck_remix

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/showcase/whtafckremix_cards.webp")}
  alt="Holographic vinyl cards"
/>

whtafck_remix printed their Designer labels on holographic vinyl. They came out looking fantastic.

## Anime0t4ku

<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/showcase/Anime0t4ku_cards.webp")} alt="New cards" />

Welcome back from the holiday Anime0t4ku! Here's some new cards from them.

## Kimberley

</video>

Kimberley has knocked it out of the park with their first batch of cards! They're printed on matte vinyl with a holographic sheet stuck on top. They look amazing.
