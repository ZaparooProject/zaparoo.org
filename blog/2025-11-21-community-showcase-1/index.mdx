Hey! I've got some really cool stuff from the community to share with you today. First up are some awesome card designs and hardware builds from our [Discord](https://zaparoo.org/discord) members, plus a couple of new community projects that you might find useful.

I'm hoping to turn this into a regular series, so if you've made something cool with Zaparoo, please share it in the Discord!

  alt="Reader inside N64 cart"

[Thwonp](https://github.com/thwonp) built a custom NFC reader inside an N64 cartridge shell. Love it. Totally awesome how clean it's come out.

And this great custom card storage box from ArielAces, made up for another member.

## Community Projects

I love seeing new software projects that work with Zaparoo. Here's a couple that are somewhat related for generating card labels. These work a bit differently to the [Designer](https://design.zaparoo.com/), they generate labels in bulk using your existing scraped metadata.

### ZaparooSkraper

[AchillesPDX](https://github.com/AchillesPDX) has made a custom Mix for [Skraper](https://www.skraper.net/) that generates card labels.

### zaparoo-helpers

[Thwonp](https://github.com/thwonp) put together some bash scripts that make it easier to compose and print custom cards.
