The bulk of the migration from the old wiki is now complete. Instead of going to wiki.zaparoo.org, you can now find the same content on the [Docs](/docs) section of the site.

<!--truncate-->

Most things will be exactly like before, but I have taken the opportunity to clean up some of the content, make it more consistent and make it up-to-date with the current state of Zaparoo.

There shouldn't be any breaking changes, but if you notice anything missing or broken, please let me know!

During the week, I'll be shutting down the wiki.zaparoo.org server and settings up redirects so that the old URLs will continue to work as they did before.
