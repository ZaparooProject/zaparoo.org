The Zaparoo App v1.6.0 update is now available in the [App
Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zaparoo/id6480331015) and [Play
Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.wizzo.tapto). This
release adds new deep link support and fixes some styling issues with
the previous release.

## Deep Links

The Zaparoo App now supports deep links, allowing you to use standard links to the
domain `zaparoo.app` and send actions to the app directly. There are currently
two supported actions:

- `https://zaparoo.app/run?v=<zapscript>` which will forward the user to the
  Zaparoo App (if it's installed) and run the specified ZapScript on the currently
  connected device.
- `https://zaparoo.app/write?v=<zapscript>` which will open the Zaparoo App and
  immediately start an NFC write operation, asking the user to tap an NFC tag.

If a user doesn't have the app installed, they'll just browse to a static web page
explaining where they can download the app from the App Store or Play Store.

Here are some example links:

- [Exit to menu](https://zaparoo.app/run?v=**launch.system:menu)
- [Launch random Genesis game](https://zaparoo.app/run?v=**launch.random:Genesis)
- [Write an insert coin card](https://zaparoo.app/write?v=**input.coinp1:1)

I really like this feature because it's so easy for anyone to integrate their
own ideas into Zaparoo. Let the app worry about the details of how to run a script
and what device to run it on. You could make your own simple static website of
commands without any complicated setup or server-side dependencies.

## Other Changes

- Launching Zap Links from Zaparoo Online will not require an app purchase.
- Fixed various style and padding issues introduced in the last release.
- Added a "copy to clipboard" button to some elements in the app.
- Updated the Patron list.
