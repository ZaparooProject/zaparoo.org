import Gallery from "@site/src/components/Gallery";

Hey! Welcome back to the community showcase. I've got another batch of awesome stuff from our [Discord](https://zaparoo.org/discord) members to share. Some really cool hardware builds this time, plus a new tool for generating card labels.

]} />

spellwells made this full Skyrim box set using an NES cartridge with NFC tag inside, complete with booklet and box. Love the presentation on this one.

## Zag

  { src: "/img/showcase/Zag_sleeve2.webp", width: 546, height: 1200, alt: "NFC card sleeve template" },
]} />

Zag made a printable template for sleeves that fit standard NFC cards. Great option if you don't have sticker paper, and super cheap to make.

You can make your own sleeves in the [Zaparoo Designer](https://design.zaparoo.org/) right now by selecting the Foldable sleeve media type! Thank you Asturur for adding it.

## tycal

<Gallery captions={false} media={[
  { src: "/img/showcase/tycal_tv_build.webp", width: 701, height: 1200, alt: "Retro TV Kodi setup" },
]} />

I've featured this before but here's another shot of tycal's retro TV setup running Zaparoo on Kodi. Still looks so good.

## 强哥

]} />

强哥 built a complete mini Zaparoo arcade with NFC Engine reader, printed cards, and a working coin slot for adding credits. Love it.

## Pullle

  { src: "/img/showcase/Pullle_shelfmode3.webp", width: 1200, height: 900, alt: "SHELFMODE project" },
  { src: "/img/showcase/Pullle_shelfmode4.webp", width: 1200, height: 900, alt: "SHELFMODE project" },
]} />

Pullle's SHELFMODE project: a custom ACR122U reader case and 3D printed cartridges with NFC stickers. This is the first project I've seen using vertically oriented carts! Check out the [MakerWorld page](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2209488-shelfmode-the-physical-game-launcher-for-pc) if you want to print your own.

## tangocat

]} />

tangocat built this using a RetroFlag PiStation case with the NFC reader hidden under the disc drive lid. So clean.

<Gallery captions={false} media={[
  { src: "/img/showcase/Anime0t4ku_nfc_card_generator.webp", width: 1200, height: 931, alt: "NFC Card Generator" },
]} />

Anime0t4ku built the NFC Card Generator, a desktop app for generating printable NFC card labels. It pulls images from SteamGrid and TMDB and has custom templates. Always cool to see people building their own tools. Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Anime0t4ku/NFC-Card-Generator).

<Gallery captions={false} media={[
  { src: "/img/showcase/Anime0t4ku_collection.webp", width: 1200, height: 900, alt: "Anime0t4ku card collection" },
]} />

And here's a shot of Anime0t4ku's card collection. It keeps growing!

## Babixbabix

  { src: "/img/showcase/Babixbabix_gb_shell.webp", width: 965, height: 1200, alt: "Gameboy shell reader" },

Babixbabix put an NFC reader inside a Gameboy shell. You slot the card in the top!

Another look at LoVeMaKeRz' amazing mini console reader collection. They've got a bunch of these now. Join the [Discord](https://zaparoo.org/discord) if you want to see more of them.

  { type: "video", poster: "/img/showcase/hobbett_numpad_launcher_thumb.webp", src: "/img/showcase/hobbett_numpad_launcher.mp4", width: 480, height: 854, alt: "Numpad launcher" },
]} />

hobbett built this reader with a numpad attached. Punch in numbers to launch games! Such a fun idea.
