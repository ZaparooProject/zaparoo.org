The Zaparoo Designer v1.0.1 is now published at the usual [place](https://designer.zaparoo.org).

While we are working on a major restyle of the user interface, this is a bugfix release.
Some user reported that the cards printed in pdf raster were misplaced and clipped, and that vector mode was sometimes not returning any pdf.
On top of that some features have been added...
{/* truncate */}

The label misplacing was a recent bug and has been fixed.
The incompatible file in vector mode was a long standing issue, we didn't think it was common to get back WEBP from the search apis, but eventually it was happening and it has been reported.
The necessary code for image detection and conversion has been added and now both GIF and WEBP are supported.
With the PDF vector fixed, we moved vector as the default option for printing.
Old settings are saved in your browser memory, so if you previously selected raster, that will continue to be your selected option.

Recently we started to add more resources to the app in order to customize your cards.
Logos, console images, extra search results and text support.
Those feature aren't easily discoverable right now but are powerful and for this reason we are reworking the UI in order to make them more accessible.
Today you can find those using the edit button under each card:

<Gallery captions={false} media={[ { src: "/img/blog/designer-v1.0.1/card1.webp", width: 540, height: 540, alt: "Edit button" },{ src: "/img/blog/designer-v1.0.1/card2.webp", width: 2158, height: 1186, alt: "Resource button" }, { src: "/img/blog/designer-v1.0.1/card3.webp", width: 1942, height: 1204, alt: "Resources" } ]} />

**The highlights:**

- fix: Correct zoom level for card in raster mode
- fix: Support for GIF/WEBP in pdf vector mode
- Moved default pdf option to vector
