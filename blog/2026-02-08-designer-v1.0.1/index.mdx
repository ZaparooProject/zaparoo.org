The Zaparoo Designer v1.0.1 is now published at the usual [place](https://design.zaparoo.org).

While we are working on a major restyle of the user interface, this is a bugfix release.
Some users reported that the cards printed in PDF raster were misplaced and clipped, and that vector mode was sometimes not returning any PDF.
On top of that some features have been added...
{/* truncate */}

The label misplacing was a recent bug and has been fixed.

The incompatible file in vector mode was a long-standing issue. We didn't expect WEBP results from the search APIs to be common, but it was happening more than we thought. The necessary code for image detection and conversion has been added and now both GIF and WEBP are supported.

With the PDF vector fixed, vector is now the default option for printing. Old settings are saved in your browser memory, so if you previously selected raster, that will continue to be your selected option.

Recently we started to add more resources to the app in order to customize your cards. Logos, console images, extra search results and text support.

Those features aren't easily discoverable right now, but they're powerful. For this reason we're reworking the UI to make them more accessible. Today you can find those using the edit button under each card:
