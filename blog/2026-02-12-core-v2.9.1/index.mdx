## Improvements

- **Log uploads** now use Zaparoo's own service (logs.zaparoo.org) instead of termbin. It's a simple [rustypaste](https://github.com/orhun/rustypaste) instance for anyone curious
- **Media scanner lazy loading** for faster resume on large libraries
- **MQTT publisher** now retries connection in the background instead of blocking startup
- **Offline arcade game lookups** on MiSTer first boot via an embedded ArcadeDB fallback
- **Playlist commands** are no longer incorrectly treated as media launches, and now trigger a fail sound when something goes wrong
- **Structured GitHub issue forms** for bug reports, feature requests, and questions (thanks [Anime0t4ku](https://github.com/Anime0t4ku))

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed MiSTer deadlock when displaying overlays while media was active, and added MGL reset tag support for cores like Jaguar
- Fixed reader disconnects causing duplicate token scans
- Fixed re-indexing a single system wiping tag associations
- Fixed some settings and launcher config changes not taking effect until restart
- Fixed `scan_feedback=false` being ignored
- Custom sounds are now correctly detected from the assets folder
- Fixed non-Steam games not detected due to inconsistent VDF key casing
- Fixed Batocera scanning without a game running opening manufacturer menu
- Fixed PN532 readers stuck in failed reconnection after disconnect
- Fixed libnfc connection string corruption breaking PN532 I2C/UART readers
- Fixed NTP clock sync falsely triggering reader reconnection on MiSTer boot
- Fixed concurrent reader close operations crashing the service
- Fixed exit delay timers losing sub-second precision
- Fixed reinserting card during hold-mode countdown not cancelling exit
- Fixed timer goroutine leaks when scans were interrupted
- Fixed platform scanners (RetroBat, Kodi) accidentally wiping other launchers' indexed files
- Fixed generic launchers intercepting launches meant for more specific launchers
