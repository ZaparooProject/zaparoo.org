We've launched a new YouTube channel for Zaparoo! Check it out at: [https://www.youtube.com/@HeyZaparoo](https://www.youtube.com/@HeyZaparoo)

I wanted to make an up-to-date overview of Zaparoo, as of the Batocera release, so I made this channel. That also got me thinking as well, what if I kept uploading things here? That would be cool. So I haven't committed to anything yet but I'm interested in continuing to make videos here about different parts of the project. If you've got something you'd like to see or something you've made that you'd like to share, please let me know!

In the meantime, here's a video I made about the new Batocera support:

Please like, share and subscribe to make me feel better. üëç
