## What's New

- **New German translation**: huge thank you to [Ze Conehead](https://github.com/ze-conehead) for this contribution!
- Added a new stop button in the now playing section.
- Non-Pro users can now use launches a few times a day to try out Zaparoo.
- The NFC/Camera toggle has been changed to a single camera button. I think this will make accessing the camera easier.
- Launch on scan/continuous scan toggles have been moved to the settings page (feedback please if this is a bad change!).
- Zaparoo.app deep links are now MUCH more reliable.
- Copy text buttons are less loud to look at.
- Core version and platform is now displayed under the device address input.
- App will no longer crash to a blank page if there's an unhandled error.
- Page swiping is now smoother and more consistent.
- Credits updated for patrons and contributors.
