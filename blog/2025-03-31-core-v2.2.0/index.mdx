Zaparoo Core v2.2.0 is now available! This release includes many features like
new MiSTer core support, new UI and added capabilities for
[ZapScript](https://wiki.zaparoo.org/ZapScript). Enjoy!

As usual, Core will also be automatically updated on MiSTer via Update All.

## New MiSTer Core Support

- [Agg23's Game and Watch](https://github.com/agg23/fpga-gameandwatch) core is
  now automatically detected and supported.
- NeoGeo CD now works correctly thanks to
  [mrchrisster](https://github.com/mrchrisster/MiSTer_SAM).
- Amiga CD32 is now supported thanks to
  [mrchrisster](https://github.com/mrchrisster/MiSTer_SAM).
- Support for GroovyMiSTer .gmc files added. See below.
- CD-i core is now supported.
- Jaguar core is now supported.
- MSX1 core is now supported.

### GroovyMiSTer GMC Proxy

The GroovyMiSTer core already supports GMC files as a means to launch PC games
from the MiSTer core. [BossRighteous](https://github.com/BossRighteous) has
provided optional Zaparoo utilities to the enable GMC scanning and launching of
these defined PC-emulator titles over the network along with the GroovyMiSTer
core. This enables Zaparoo-MiSTer NFC and API loading of Groovy enabled
emulators including MAME, RetroArch, Mednafen, and Dolphin.

## Text User Interface

A new text-based interface has been created and included in Core, thanks to work
by [Asturur](https://github.com/asturur) and
[davasi](https://bsky.app/profile/davasi.bsky.social). This UI is similar to the
old TapTUI script, but is now built into the Core application itself and
cross-platform. While the App and Web UI will remain the primary interfaces for
Zaparoo, the TUI will be kept up-to-date with most essential/basic features.

People have requested a way to manage Zaparoo using a controller and there are
some cases where a TUI is more accessible than a phone or web interface, so we
want to start accomodating that. It will also mean it's possible to get started
with Zaparoo again using nothing but a MiSTer, controller and NFC reader which
is cool!

The TUI is available by running the `zaparoo` entry in the MiSTer Scripts menu
and selecting the `Config` button on the status screen. This UI isn't as fully
featured as the original TapTUI script, but over time it will be improved to
reach the same level. [Feedback is welcome!](https://zaparoo.org/discord)

## Zaparoo Online

I have been working on a new service called Zaparoo Online. I'm not ready to
announce it properly yet, but it requires some new features added to Core which
will be available right now. All features I'm adding for Online will be
optional, and in most cases possible to self-host, so calm ya farm ok.

The new features are still in development and undocumented, but you're welcome
to try them out or ask me about them. Please keep in mind the API is not final.

### Remote ZapScript

ZapScript can now be loaded on-the-fly from a remote URL. Write a single URL to
a token which serves a special JSON payload, Core will fetch and execute it.
There is no special allowlisting or anything for this feature, it just relies on
the URL serving a valid payload _and_ using the MIME type
`application/vnd.zaparoo.script`. There are some limitations set on this right
now, specifically the `input.keyboard` and `input.gamepad` commands are disabled
when running remote ZapScript. This is to prevent malicious scripts from
interacting with the system in unexpected ways. They may be re-enabled in a safe
way later but for now fully blocked!

The "special JSON payload" brings us to...

### ZapScript as JSON

Over time Core will support an alternate format of the existing ZapScript
format, which would allow ZapScript to be defined as a JSON object. For most
people this means nothing, but it will make it much easier for applications to
generate and parse ZapScript, for ZapScript to be validated and for complex
arguments to be defined.

The JSON format is not final yet but initial setup is included inside this
release for a migration path. The new format will map 1:1 with the existing
format, so people can choose to use either format. They are interchangeable.

The remote ZapScript feature requires payloads to be in this format, for
example:

```json
{
  "zapscript": 1,
  "cmds": [
    {
      "cmd": "launch",
      "args": {
        "path": "/path/to/some/game.bin"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### UI Widgets

In order to give feedback and choices to users, Core will now start supporting
various UI widgets that can be triggered via ZapScript. Currently they're only
available on MiSTer, but the plan is to make them work the same/similar on all
platforms.

UI widgets are supposed to be non-intrusive. They will always be dismissable and
later simply disabled if desired.

#### Notice

A simple text box displayed on screen with a message. Can be dismissed by the
user or closed programmatically.

#### Loader

Same as a notice, but includes an animated spinner to show something is
happening.

#### Picker

Displays a list of items on screen which can be selected by the user. Once an
item is selected, it's forwarded to the Core API to be run. Each item has
associated ZapScript.

This one is actually awesome! It adds a lot of capabilities to Zaparoo. It can
be used to select from a list of games or any other command supported by
ZapScript.

### Remote Media Install & Launch

Another **really** cool addition, Core can now install media from a remote
source. This feature is still very much in beta and MiSTer-only, but I'll be
fleshing this out for other platforms too.

For example, serve a JSON payload with the MIME type
`application/vnd.zaparoo.media` like this:

```json
{
  "zapscript": 1,
  "cmds": [
    {
      "cmd": "launch",
      "args": {
        "name": "Some Game",
        "system": "Genesis",
        "url": "https://example.com/path/to/media.bin"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's say this is hosted on `https://example.com/media.json` and you've written
that to an NFC tag. Once you scan, Core will automatically download the media
from the URL and launch it locally. Once it's installed, Core will use the local
version only. This feels wicked in person!

## Windows Improvements

### System Tray

I've made some small UI improvements to the Windows version of Core. Now when
the app is launched, it will no longer show a command line window and instead
just live in the system tray. The system tray menu also has direct links to
things like the built-in web UI, config folder, etc.

A small change but it's made the thing feel a lot more polished and native
already. It also means you can set Core to run on startup in the background.

### LaunchBox Config

The LaunchBox launcher can now have a custom install directory set via the
config file. This was a long-standing issue since LaunchBox doesn't have a
default location. You can set it by adding this to your `config.toml` file:

```toml
[[launchers.default]]
launcher = 'LaunchBox'
install_dir = 'C:\\Users\\wizzo\\CustomLBDir'
```

This change has also generally allowed configuration of launchers, so more
options may be added in the future for various cores and emulators.

## Other Changes

- Core will now notify [Super Attract
  Mode](https://github.com/mrchrisster/MiSTer_SAM) if it launches a game, so
  they won't conflict with each other.
- Arcade games will now send a "started" notificiation over the API on launch.
- New API method `run.script` added to support ZapScript JSON migration. It may
  not be permanent.
- New `evaluate` command added to ZapScript to support JSON migration. It may
  not be permanent.

## Known Issues

- Sometimes the script version of the UI widgets will not display and show an
  error about a file not being found. Please let me know if you see this too!
