## What is this page for?

In response to impersonation attempts, we have minted official tokens on three major blockchains. This page serves as the authoritative source for verifying legitimate Zaparoo token contract addresses.

These tokens serve as official verification markers and are for visibility purposes only. They currently provide no utility or functionality. They cannot be traded.

These contracts secure the official Zaparoo identity on these blockchains for any potential future applications.

**Always cross-reference addresses on this page before making any transactions.**
