## Error Reporting

Zaparoo has built-in error reporting powered by [Sentry](https://sentry.io). Error reports are anonymized and contain no personal information, but this is off by default for privacy. Turning it on helps us find and fix bugs faster.

To enable error reporting:
1. Open the Zaparoo App or TUI
2. Go to **Settings > Advanced**
3. Enable **Error Reporting**

## Collecting Logs

Here's how to get your log file:

### Via Zaparoo App

1. Go to **Settings > Advanced > View logs**
2. Tap one of:
   - **Download** (<Download size={16} />) to save the log file
   - **Upload** (<Upload size={16} />) to send it to *logs.zaparoo.org* and get a shareable link

### Via TUI

1. Go to **Settings > Logs**
2. Select one of:
   - **Copy** to save the log file
   - **Upload** to send it to *logs.zaparoo.org* and get a shareable link

:::warning[MiSTer Only]
The Zaparoo log file on MiSTer is deleted every time the system is powered off. Make sure to collect logs after encountering an issue and before turning off the MiSTer.
:::

## Debug Logging

Debug logging captures more detailed information than standard logs. It's disabled by default because it can make logs noisy.

To enable debug logging:
1. Open the Zaparoo App or TUI
2. Go to **Settings > Advanced**
3. Enable **Debug Logging**
4. Reproduce the issue you're troubleshooting
5. Collect the logs as described above

:::tip
All these settings can also be configured directly in the [config file](/docs/core/config).
