## Project Licensing

Zaparoo is made up of multiple individual projects, each with its own licensing. You must check for the specific license of a project when you are sharing or adapting a project.

Generally, Zaparoo projects are published under a copyleft license:

- For software projects: GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3) (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)
- For content projects such as images, 3D models and PCB designs: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

These licenses allow you to freely share and adapt the project if attribution is retained, and the existing attached license is not changed. Commercial use is allowed. You must read the full license terms attached to a project for specific agreements.

Some projects or sub-projects within projects may be published under a different license such as a non-commercial variant.

Some projects may contain licensed Zaparoo trademarks which may need to be removed for redistribution or adaptation outside the official project and hosting.

## Zaparoo Trademarks

The Zaparoo wordmark (name) and logos are trademarks owned by Wizzo Pty Ltd which retains all rights to them. These trademarks are licensed for use by each officially hosted Zaparoo project, in its original location, unless specified otherwise. These trademarks are not freely available to use in any other personal or commercial projects or products without explicit permission from the owner.

You may:

- Use the Zaparoo wordmark in text to truthfully refer to or link to official Zaparoo projects, products and websites.
- Use the Zaparoo logos in visuals to truthfully refer to or link to official Zaparoo projects, products and websites.
- Use the Zaparoo wordmark to truthfully explain that your own project or product is compatible with (e.g. “Zaparoo compatible” or “compatible with Zaparoo”) or based on an official Zaparoo project.

**All other uses of the Zaparoo trademarks require prior written permission from the trademark owner.** Contact trademark@zaparoo.com for more information about Zaparoo trademark permissions and requesting a usage agreement.

Below are some common examples of how the Zaparoo trademarks can and cannot be used. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis by contacting the trademark owner.

### Card Labels, Case Models and Other Designs

The Zaparoo trademarks must not appear on token label designs (such as card labels), reader device designs, host device designs or any other related items without prior written permission to do so.

See the [Zaparoo Media](/projects/) project for examples of marks that are free to use for displaying token or device compatibility.

### Adapting or Forking Zaparoo Projects

When adapting or forking an open source Zaparoo project, you must not use any of the included Zaparoo trademarks in any user-facing branding of your own adaptation or incorrectly suggest that your own project is published by, affiliated with or endorsed by Zaparoo.

### Commercial Use and Endorsement

You must not use any Zaparoo trademarks in the name or branding of your business, domain, app, merchandise, etc.; or display it in any way that incorrectly implies affiliation with or endorsement by Zaparoo.

### Contribution Agreements

Commercial usage agreements for Zaparoo trademarks may be available in exchange for significant contributions back to the official open source Zaparoo projects. Contact the trademark owner for more information.
