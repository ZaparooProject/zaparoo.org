# Upgrade Stickers

**Upgrade stickers** are a set size for smaller stickers/labels which fit on printed cards and standard NFC card labels. They let larger designs be printed in bulk while still allowing customization later that fits well with the overall design. They're easier to apply than full size labels and are designed to look good without a corner rounder tool.

An upgrade sticker area is always 36.75mm (1.45in) high with a variable size width. Some common sizes to cut are below.

A "full" size means to cut flush to the full size of the area, which may also be flush to the edge of a card. A "frame" size leaves a 1mm gap around the edge and uses the upgrade sticker area's background as a frame for the sticker. A "double area" sticker refers specifically to cards which contain two upgrade sticker areas, and an upgrade sticker which would cover both areas at once.
