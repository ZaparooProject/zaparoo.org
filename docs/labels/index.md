### Design Guidelines

**Label Positioning:** Zaparoo labels include a 1/32" (0.79mm) margin from the card edge for:
- Application error tolerance
- Improved durability (prevents edge peeling)
- Professional appearance that matches NFC card proportions

**Artwork Margins** (from label edge):
- **Horizontal Layout:** 3.1mm margin on top/right/bottom, 26.2mm margin on left
- **Vertical Layout:** 3.1mm margin on top/right/left, 12.2mm margin on bottom

**Quality Standards:**
- Use 300+ DPI resolution for crisp printing
- CMYK color mode for commercial printing
- Appropriate color profiles for your printing method

### Upgrade Stickers

Upgrade stickers are smaller labels designed to fit on existing printed cards for easy customization. They let larger designs be printed in bulk while still allowing customization later. They're easier to apply than full size labels and designed to look good without a corner rounder tool.

All upgrade stickers are 36.75mm (1.45in) high with variable width:

**Common Sizes:**
- **Zap Trading Cards:** 63×36.75mm (single area) or 63×75mm (double area with 1.5mm gap between areas)
- **Standard Labels:** 47.4×36.75mm (single area)
- **Frame Style:** Leave 1mm border for background frame effect
