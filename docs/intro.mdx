# Introduction

:::tip

New to Zaparoo? Make sure to read the [Getting Started](/start/) guide, which explains everything
necessary to get up and running quickly. Getting started is easy, getting it perfect for _you_ is fun!

:::

Zaparoo is an open system for launching media using physical objects. It allows you to do things like launch your
favorite game by tapping an [NFC card](./tokens/nfc/index.md) or watch a movie by scanning a [QR code](./tokens/qr-codes.md). This is achieved primarily using the
[Zaparoo Core](./core/index.md) software, but Zaparoo is also an ecosystem of software, hardware and artwork which all works together to make an
awesome tactile experience with your media!

These docs cover all aspects of the Zaparoo project. Pick a section that interests you and dive in.
