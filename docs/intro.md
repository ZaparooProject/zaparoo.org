Zaparoo is an open system for launching media using physical objects. It allows you to do things like launch your
favorite game by tapping an NFC card or watch a movie by scanning a QR code. This is achieved primarily using the
Zaparoo Core software, but Zaparoo is also an ecosystem of software and hardware which all works together to make an
awesome tactile experience with your media!
