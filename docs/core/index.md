# Core

Zaparoo Core is a software service which runs in the background of supported platform devices. This service manages and coordinates all aspects of making Zaparoo work as a system, including:

- Supporting [NFC reader hardware](/docs/readers) communication and managing reader connections
- Supporting different types of [NFC tags](/docs/tokens) and reading data from them
- Interpreting and launching [token commands](/docs/zapscript)
- Launching, managing and monitoring media and associated launchers
- Indexing, storing and querying a database of media available from the device
- Publishing and managing its own device instance of the [Zaparoo API](/docs/api)

The core Zaparoo software is free and open source under the [GPLv3 license](/docs/licenses), hosted and developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/ZaparooProject/tapto) including releases.
