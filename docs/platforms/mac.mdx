# macOS

:::danger
This platform isn't released yet! It's not ready for production use.
:::

:::warning

macOS support is still in beta. The Zaparoo App and most hardware is supported, but launching media is done via shell scripts until proper launcher support is added.

:::

| Item               | Path                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Data directory     | `~/Library/Application Support/zaparoo`          |
| Mappings directory | `~/Library/Application Support/zaparoo/mappings` |
| Config file        | `~/Library/Preferences/zaparoo/config.toml`      |
| Log file           | `~/Library/Logs/zaparoo/core.log`                |

<small>_Where `~` is the home directory of the current user._</small>

## Install

Download Zaparoo Core for macOS from the [Downloads page](/downloads/), unzip it and copy
the `zaparoo` file to `/usr/local/bin`. This guide assumes you copied it to this location.

:::tip

If you don't have `/usr/local/bin` in your PATH, you can also install it to `~/bin` or any other directory in your PATH.

:::

Open Terminal and go to the directory where you copied the `zaparoo` file:

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin
```

Run the install command in Zaparoo:

```bash
./zaparoo -install
```

:::info

This command does the following:

- Creates a udev rule allowing users to read NFC reader serial devices.
- Creates a modprobe blacklist entry to fix a bug stopping ACR122U readers from working.
- Creates a launchd service to run Zaparoo in the background.

:::

Start the Zaparoo service by either using the launchd service:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.zaparoo.core.plist
```

Or just by adding the `zaparoo` file to your startup applications.

From this point, Zaparoo should be running and the App should connect to your device. You can now connect a reader and set up cards using the Zaparoo App.

If you want to undo the changes performed by the install command, you can run the uninstall command:

```bash
./zaparoo -uninstall
```

## Supported Readers

## Supported Launchers

| Launcher | Extensions | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|

Currently, you must use shell scripts to launch media on macOS. See the [Linux page](./linux.mdx#launchers) for more information on how to set up launchers this way.
