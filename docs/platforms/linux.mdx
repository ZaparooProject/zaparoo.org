# Linux

:::warning

Linux support is still in beta. The Zaparoo App and most hardware is supported, but launching media is done via shell scripts until proper launcher support is added.

:::

:::tip

This is the base of most other platforms that Zaparoo supports. If you don't see your platform listed already (and it's Linux-based) there's a good chance you can get Zaparoo running using this version.

| Item               | Path                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Data directory     | `~/.local/share/zaparoo`             |
| Mappings directory | `~/.local/share/zaparoo/mappings`    |
| Config file        | `~/.config/zaparoo/config.toml`      |
| Log file           | `/tmp/<session_id>-zaparoo/core.log` |

<small>_Where `~` is the home directory of the current user._</small>

## Install

Download Zaparoo Core for Linux from the [Downloads page](/downloads/), unzip it and copy
the `zaparoo` file somewhere like the home directory, desktop or a bin directory like `/usr/local/bin`.

We'll assume you copied the `zaparoo` file to your home directory. Replace paths in the examples if that's not the case.

Open terminal and go to the directory where you copied the `zaparoo` file:

```bash
cd $HOME
```

Run the install command in Zaparoo:

```bash
./zaparoo -install
```

:::info

This command does the following:

- Creates a udev rule allowing users to read NFC reader serial devices.
- Creates a modprobe blacklist entry to fix a bug stopping ACR122U readers from working.
- Creates a user systemd service to run Zaparoo in the background.

:::

Start the Zaparoo service by either using the systemd service:

```bash
systemctl --user enable zaparoo.service
systemctl --user start zaparoo.service
```

Or just by adding the `zaparoo` file to your startup applications, depending on your desktop environment.

From this point, Zaparoo should be running and the App should connect to your device. You can now connect a reader and set up cards using the Zaparoo App.

If you want to undo the changes performed by the install command, you can run the uninstall command:

```bash
./zaparoo -uninstall
```

## Launchers

Currently, you must use shell scripts to launch media on Linux.

## Example: Creating a Launcher Script for an Emulator

Suppose you want to use Zaparoo to launch a game in an emulator (for example, running a NES game with the `fceux` emulator). Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Create a Shell Script**

Open your text editor and paste the following example, replacing the paths with your emulator and game:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example: ~/launch_nes.sh

# Path to your emulator
EMULATOR="/usr/bin/fceux"

# Path to your game ROM
GAME="$HOME/games/nes/SuperMarioBros.nes"

# Run the emulator with the game
"$EMULATOR" "$GAME"
```

:::tip

If you’re not familiar with editing files in the terminal, you can use a graphical text editor like "Text Editor", "Gedit", or "Kate" to open and edit `~/.config/zaparoo/config.toml`.

:::

Save this as `launch_nes.sh` in your home directory.

2. **Make the Script Executable**

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
chmod +x ~/launch_nes.sh
```

3. **Add the Script to the `allow_file` Config Entry**

Open your Zaparoo config file at `~/.config/zaparoo/config.toml` in a text editor. Find or add the `allow_file` entry under the `[launchers]` section. For example:

```toml
[launchers]
allow_file = [
  "^/home/yourusername/launch_nes.sh$"
]
```

Replace `/home/yourusername/launch_nes.sh` with the full path to your script.  
If you want to allow multiple scripts, add them as separate lines:

```toml
[core]
allow_file = [
  "^/home/yourusername/launch_nes.sh$",
  "^/home/yourusername/launch_snes.sh$",
  "^/home/yourusername/launch_psx.sh$"
]
```

4. **Restart Zaparoo**

To apply the changes, restart the Zaparoo service. In your terminal, run:

```bash
systemctl --user restart zaparoo.service
```

5. **Write the Script Path to a Card**

Now, Zaparoo can use your launcher script(s) to run games or other media!

You can write the full path to the new script to a card: `/home/yourusername/launch_nes.sh`.
