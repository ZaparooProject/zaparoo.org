## Launchers

| Launcher      | Systems | Notes                               |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Steam         | PC      | Games and non-Steam shortcuts       |
| ChimeraGOG    | PC      | GOG games from Chimera web app      |
| Shell Scripts | Any     | Custom `.sh` file execution         |

### Steam

Launches games from your Steam library. Both official Steam games and non-Steam shortcuts added to your library are detected.

Games are indexed from:
- `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/`
- `~/.local/share/Steam/`

To manually launch a Steam game, write `steam://<app_id>` to a token.

### ChimeraGOG

Zaparoo automatically indexes GOG games installed through the Chimera web app.

Games are indexed from:
- `~/.local/share/chimera/content/gog/`

Games are launched using the `gog://` scheme.

### Shell Scripts

Execute arbitrary shell scripts. Requires explicit allow list configuration for security.

```toml title="config.toml"
[launchers]
allow_file = [
    "^/home/gamer/scripts/.*\\.sh$"
]
```
