# ChimeraOS

:::warning[Beta]
ChimeraOS support is currently in beta. Some features may not work as expected.
:::

Zaparoo Core on [ChimeraOS](https://chimeraos.org/) supports launching Steam games, GOG games via the Chimera web app, and shell scripts. Release builds are available for both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures.

## File Paths

| Item               | Path                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Config file        | `~/.config/zaparoo/config.toml`        |
| Data directory     | `~/.local/share/zaparoo`               |
| Log file           | `/tmp/<session_id>-zaparoo/core.log`   |
| Mappings directory | `~/.local/share/zaparoo/mappings`      |

Where `~` is the home directory of the `gamer` user.

## Install

Access the terminal with `Ctrl+Alt+F2` (default credentials: `gamer` / `gamer`) and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://zaparoo.org/install.sh | bash
```

This installs all necessary components and sets up the service to run on startup. Since ChimeraOS has an immutable root filesystem, the installation is user-local (installed to `~/.local/bin`).

To uninstall:

```bash
~/.local/bin/zaparoo -uninstall application
~/.local/bin/zaparoo -uninstall service
~/.local/bin/zaparoo -uninstall desktop
sudo ~/.local/bin/zaparoo -uninstall hardware
```

## Readers

All [readers](../readers/index.md) are supported.

## Launchers

| Launcher      | Systems | Notes                               |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Steam         | PC      | Games and non-Steam shortcuts       |
| ChimeraGOG    | PC      | GOG games from Chimera web app      |
| Shell Scripts | Any     | Custom `.sh` file execution         |

### Steam

Launches games from your Steam library. Both official Steam games and non-Steam shortcuts added to your library are detected.

Games are indexed from:
- `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/`
- `~/.local/share/Steam/`

To manually launch a Steam game, write `steam://<app_id>` to a token.

### ChimeraGOG

Zaparoo automatically indexes GOG games installed through the Chimera web app.

Games are indexed from:
- `~/.local/share/chimera/content/gog/`

Games are launched using the `gog://` scheme.

### Shell Scripts

Execute arbitrary shell scripts. Requires explicit allow list configuration for security.

```toml title="config.toml"
[launchers]
allow_file = [
    "^/home/gamer/scripts/.*\\.sh$"
]
```
