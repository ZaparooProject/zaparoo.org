# Commodore 64

The Commodore 64 is not a directly supported platform for Zaparoo Core, however it is possible to use Zaparoo tokens with a real Commodore 64 via the [TeensyROM project](https://github.com/SensoriumEmbedded/TeensyROM/).

TeensyROM is a custom cartridge for the Commodore 64 that adds many features, including support for the [PN532 NFC reader](/docs/readers/nfc/pn532-usb.md). Take a look at the [NFC guide](https://github.com/SensoriumEmbedded/TeensyROM/blob/main/docs/NFC_Loader.md) on the TeensyROM GitHub for more information.
