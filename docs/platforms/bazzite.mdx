# Bazzite

:::danger
This platform isn't released yet! It's not ready for production use.
:::

:::warning

Bazzite support is still in beta. The Zaparoo App and most hardware is supported, but launching media is done via shell scripts until proper launcher support is added.

:::

| Item               | Path                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Data directory     | `~/.local/share/zaparoo`             |
| Mappings directory | `~/.local/share/zaparoo/mappings`    |
| Config file        | `~/.config/zaparoo/config.toml`      |
| Log file           | `/tmp/<session_id>-zaparoo/core.log` |

<small>_Where `~` is the home directory of the current user._</small>

## Install

Download Zaparoo Core for Bazzite from the [Downloads page](/downloads/), unzip it and copy
the `zaparoo` file somewhere like the home directory or `/usr/local/bin`. This guide assumes you copied it to the home directory, replace paths in the examples if that's not the case.

:::tip

Bazzite is based on Fedora Silverblue/Kinoite, so you'll need to use `rpm-ostree` to install any additional dependencies. Most required dependencies should already be included in the base image.

:::

Open terminal and go to the directory where you copied the `zaparoo` file:

```bash
cd $HOME
```

Run the install command in Zaparoo:

```bash
./zaparoo -install
```

:::info

This command does the following:

- Creates a udev rule allowing users to read NFC reader serial devices.
- Creates a modprobe blacklist entry to fix a bug stopping ACR122U readers from working.
- Creates a user systemd service to run Zaparoo in the background.

:::

Start the Zaparoo service by either using the systemd service:

```bash
systemctl --user enable zaparoo.service
systemctl --user start zaparoo.service
```

Or just by adding the `zaparoo` file to your startup applications, depending on your desktop environment.

From this point, Zaparoo should be running and the App should connect to your device. You can now connect a reader and set up cards using the Zaparoo App.

If you want to undo the changes performed by the install command, you can run the uninstall command:

```bash
./zaparoo -uninstall
```

## Supported Readers

| Reader                                          | Status |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------|
| [PN532](../readers/nfc/pn532-usb.md)               | ✅      |
| [ACR122U](../readers/nfc/acr122u.md)       | ✅      |
| [File Reader](../readers/file.md)          | ✅      |
| [Simple Serial](../readers/simple-serial.md) | ✅      |
| [Optical Drive](../readers/optical-drive.md) | ✅      |
| [TTY2OLED](../readers/tty2oled.md)         | ✅      |

## Supported Launchers

| Launcher | Extensions | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Generic  | `.sh`     | Shell script execution |

Currently, Bazzite only supports launching shell scripts. You must create shell scripts to launch games, applications, or media. See the [Linux page](./linux.mdx#supported-launchers) for more information on how to set up launchers this way.
