## Launchers

| Launcher      | Systems | Notes                                  |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Steam         | PC      | Native and Flatpak Steam installations |
| Web Browser   | N/A     | Opens URLs in default browser          |
| Shell Scripts | Any     | Custom `.sh` file execution            |

### Steam

Launches games from your Steam library. Both native (pre-installed) and Flatpak Steam installations are automatically detected. Games are launched using `xdg-open`, which works in both desktop and gaming modes.

Games are indexed from:
- `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/`
- `~/.local/share/Steam/`

To manually launch a Steam game, write `steam://<app_id>` to a token.

### Shell Scripts

Execute arbitrary shell scripts. Requires explicit allow list configuration for security.

```toml title="config.toml"
[launchers]
allow_file = [
    "^/home/.*/scripts/.*\\.sh$"
]
```
