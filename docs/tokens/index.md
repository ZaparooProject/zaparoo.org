# Tokens

Tokens are physical objects that can be used to trigger actions in Zaparoo. The most common type of token is an NFC tag, but other types of tokens like QR codes are also supported.

There are several types of tokens that can be scanned:

- [NFC tags](./nfc/) - NFC cards and stickers
- [NFC toys](./nfc-toys/) - Amiibos, Lego Dimensions, etc.
- [PCB cards](./pcb-cards) - Custom PCBs with NFC stickers
- [QR codes and barcodes](./qr-codes)

We also have recommendations for [storing tokens](./storage/) in fun and convenient ways, like [cassette cases](./storage/cassette-cases).
