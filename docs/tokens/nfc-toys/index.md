# NFC Toys

NFC toys like Amiibo and Lego Dimensions figures can be used with Zaparoo. These toys contain NFC chips that can't be written to, but their unique ID (UID) can be read and mapped to custom actions.

## Supported Toys

- [Amiibo](./amiibo.md) - Nintendo's collectible figures
- [Lego Dimensions](./lego-dimensions.md) - Lego's interactive game figures

## How They Work

Unlike regular NFC tags, these toys are read-only for Zaparoo. The system reads their UID and looks up what action to perform based on that unique identifier.
