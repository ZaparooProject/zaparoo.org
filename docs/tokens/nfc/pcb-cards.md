# PCB Cards

Want to have some cool little PCB cards for your favorite games? All you need to do is order some of these, print some labels and stick on an NFC sticker. Please note that the small Switch cards will need smaller rectangle type NFC tags but the medium and large sized cards can take either. PCB cards project for Zaparoo was created by TheTrain.

## Ordering

### Which PCB Type To Order?

These cards are currently done in either 2-layer PCBs or 6-layer PCBs. This is because JLC PCB has great offers for doing small batch runs of green 6-layer PCBs with ENIG (gold) finish.

Due to size limitations on this deal (max 50mm x 50mm) it will only work for the switch and medium sized cards and you are limited to green PCBs. If you want to get another color, or do normal sized cards you will need to get some of the 2-layer PCB files.

JLC PCB has the same great offers on 2-layer PCBs without ENIG finish (boards will be silver) at a size up to 100mm x 100mm.

Gerber files to be uploaded to PCB manufacturer:

- [Switch card PCB v3.3](https://github.com/wizzomafizzo/tapto/tree/main/assets/pcbcards/Switch%20Cart%20PCB) - **6-layer PCB**
- [Medium card PCB v3.0](https://github.com/wizzomafizzo/tapto/tree/main/assets/pcbcards/mediumcard) - **6-layer PCB**
