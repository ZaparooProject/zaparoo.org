# MIFARE Classic

MIFARE Classic 1K tags are fully supported by Zaparoo Core. Zaparoo can natively read and write to MIFARE Classic tags, including formatting them if necessary. This includes compatibility with most Chinese clone tags.

MIFARE Classic 1K tags have 716 bytes of storage. If you order a commercial NFC reader that comes with tags, this is often the standard you'll receive.
