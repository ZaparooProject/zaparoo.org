# NTAG

The NTAG standard has the best compatibility with Zaparoo and is readily available in form factors such as cards, stickers and key chains.

There are multiple NTAG types that have been confirmed working with Zaparoo. The only difference between them is storage size:

| Standard | Storage   |
| -------- | --------- |
| NTAG213  | 144 bytes |
| NTAG215  | 504 bytes |
| NTAG216  | 888 bytes |

The NTAG215 is a generous amount of storage for Zaparoo and you shouldn't have any trouble with it. The main consideration is just needing to fit the full path of a game file on the tag.
