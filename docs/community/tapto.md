# TapTo

TapTo was the original name for the Zaparoo project. While the project is now officially called Zaparoo, the original name and logo can still be seen in the community. You are free to continue using the name "TapTo" and the associated logo in your projects, following the usage guidelines below.

The TapTo logo was contributed to the project by [Ranny Snice](https://x.com/RannySnice) who is the creator and copyright holder. The logo is, generally, free to use by anyone in their own projects. The full terms of use can be found on the [Licences](../licenses.md#tapto-logo) page.

- **Are you making a TapTo token (card, cartridge, etc.) design or template?** Please use the logo! The logo is primarily meant to show that a token will work with TapTo. We want you to use it.
- **Are you making an _open source_ hardware design?** Please use the logo! We always want to support fellow open source projects. We want you to use it.
- **Are you making a commercial closed source product?** Ask permission first! There are no licence costs or contracts, we just want to keep track of what's going on. Please ask permission directly or [open an issue](https://github.com/ZaparooProject/tapto-media/issues/new). We want you to use it.
- **Do you want to edit the logo?** Please do not do this, except for the colors. Any TapTo-adjacent spinoffs or forks should not use a modified logo. We want the logo to remain easy to recognize and understand.

We want you to use the logo in your work, but we want the logo to remain clear and recognizable for compatibility purposes. If anything is unclear about the terms of use or you feel you have a legitimate exception, please contact the project to discuss.

Reference files (including SVG) for the logo are always available in the [TapTo Media](https://github.com/ZaparooProject/tapto-media) repository on GitHub.
