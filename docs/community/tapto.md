# TapTo

TapTo was the original name for the Zaparoo project. While the project is now officially called Zaparoo, the original name and logo can still be seen in the community. You are free to continue using the name "TapTo" and the associated logo in your projects, just be aware it now has no official association with the Zaparoo project.

The TapTo logo was contributed to the project by Ranny Snice who is the creator and copyright holder. The logo is, generally, free to use by anyone in their own projects.

Reference files (including SVG) for the logo and license are always available in the [Zaparoo Media](https://github.com/ZaparooProject/zaparoo-media/tree/main/tapto-logo) repository on GitHub.
