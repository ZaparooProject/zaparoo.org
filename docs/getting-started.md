# Getting Started

This guide will give a quick run through of everything you need to start your own Zaparoo collection.

## TL;DR

1. Get some [NFC hardware](https://shop.zaparoo.com/products/zaparoo-starter-kit).
2. Install [Zaparoo Core](/downloads/#zaparoo-core).
3. Get the [Zaparoo App](https://zaparoo.app/).
4. Make some [card labels](https://design.zaparoo.org/).

## Get the Hardware

:::tip

Zaparoo can be as simple or complex as you want it to be. Here, we'll be keeping things simple,
and focusing on NFC hardware. Feel free to mix things up in this section if you've seen something else you like!

:::

You'll just need:

1. A compatible NFC reader.
2. As many compatible NFC cards as you want.

Which you can get at:

- The official [Zaparoo Shop](https://shop.zaparoo.com/), which supports the project directly.
- One of our [community vendors](/docs/community/vendors), who are great for custom reader cases.
- Or finally, if you're on a tighter budget or building a custom project, see our generic hardware recommendations in
  the [NFC readers](/docs/readers/nfc) and [NFC tags](/docs/tokens/nfc) docs.

The [Zaparoo App](/docs/app/) also works as an NFC reader for a small one-time
purchase which helps out the project. This is the fastest way to use Zaparoo if you already have some NFC
tags handy.

## Install the Software

There are two software parts to Zaparoo:

- The backend which runs in the background on your [platform device](/docs/platforms/).
- A frontend which speaks to the backend and you'll use to set up your NFC cards.

### Zaparoo Core

1. [Download Zaparoo Core](/downloads/#zaparoo-core) for your target platform.
2. Read the linked _Platform Guide_ for how to install and run it.

We try to make this as easy as possible, but every platform is a little different, so please check the guides!

### Zaparoo App

1. Install the [Zaparoo App](/downloads/#zaparoo-app) on your phone. _Essential features to use Zaparoo are free._
2. Connect it to your device running [Zaparoo Core](/docs/core/).
3. Run **Update media database** on the Settings page.

You're done! Start creating your Zaparoo cards.

:::tip

Phone doesn't have NFC? Don't stress. Zaparoo Core ships with [other ways](/docs/core/web-ui) to write to NFC cards, the App is just
the most user-friendly way to do things.

## Make the Labels

1. Generate labels using the [Zaparoo Designer](https://design.zaparoo.org/).
2. Print, cut and stick them to your cards.

Check out the [Labels](/docs/labels) docs for advice on tools and design templates.
