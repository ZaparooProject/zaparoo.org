# Optical Drive

Optical drives like CD, DVD and Blu-ray drives can be used as readers for Zaparoo. This is currently a Linux-only feature, or any platforms that are based on Linux. See the [reader driver page](/docs/core/drivers/#optical-drive) for more information on how to set one up as a reader.

The support for this is based on the operating system's own optical drive support, so it doesn't really matter what hardware you use as long as it's compatible with Linux. USB drives are the easiest option to add to existing setups, but internal drives will work just the same. CD, DVD, and Blu-ray drives all work - just pick up any drive from your local shop along with some blank discs.

At the moment Zaparoo doesn't support reading data off the disc itself, though this may be planned later.
