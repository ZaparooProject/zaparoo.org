The DIY NFC Reader is a Zaparoo community project aiming to offer a high quality and reliable reader at a low price, which is guaranteed to work with Zaparoo software.

- Can be built yourself with the [DIY NFC Reader Build Guide](/platforms/diy-reader/).
- Plug and play.
- Depending on vendor and batch size, comes at a very competitive price compared to [ACR122U](/platforms/acr122u/).
- Very small footprint with case.
- Used by other Zaparoo projects as a base.

Internally, this reader uses a [PN532](/platforms/pn532/) module and has all the same pros and cons associated with it. Having trusted vendors for this reader means none of the quality related issues with the module should be of concern.

See the [Vendors](/vendors/) page for where to buy it.
