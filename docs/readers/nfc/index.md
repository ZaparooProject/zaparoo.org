# NFC Readers

:::tip
Are you looking for a ready-to-use NFC reader? Check out the [PN532 USB](./pn532-usb.md). You can also get one from the [Zaparoo Shop](https://shop.zaparoo.com/) which supports the project.
:::

NFC readers were the first type of reader supported by Zaparoo, and currently still the best option for most users. Both the reader and tags are inexpensive, compact and easy to get online.
