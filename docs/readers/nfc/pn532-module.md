# PN532 Module

The PN532 is a popular NFC chip used in many readers. Zaparoo supports several PN532-based readers, including both ready-to-use USB modules and bare modules for custom projects.

:::warning
The PN532 module is not a ready-to-use reader, it's a bare PCB module intended for custom projects. It can be used directly with Zaparoo via a USB to serial adapter.
:::

- Very cheap price, starting at around $3 USD.
- Small footprint and is great for custom projects.
- High quality modules have excellent short and long range reading (up to 5cm without interference).
- Plug and play when paired with a USB to serial adapter (UART).
- Has no case and will not function at all without additional components.
- Build quality can be very variable depending on vendor, resulting in non-functioning modules or poor read range.
- Requires soldering equipment (but is a great beginner project).

### Known Issues

Build quality and shipping of these modules can vary a lot between vendors. In general they are OK, but be cautious about choosing the cheapest possible option.

Some modules may use low quality inductors connecting the antenna. This can result in a module that appears to function fine, but has extremely poor read range. It is possible to replace the inductors with new ones that are to spec.

Not necessarily related to the module, but some USB to serial adapters can have poor quality voltage regulators, which are not good enough to power the module properly.
