# RC522

The RC522 is an RFID module based on the MFRC522 chip from NXP semiconductors. Operating at 13.56MHz, it's designed for basic RFID applications and hobbyist projects rather than full NFC functionality.

- Starting at around $3-5 USD (similar price to PN532).
- Supports ISO14443A protocol (MIFARE Classic, MIFARE 1K/4K).
- Multiple interfaces: SPI, I2C, and UART communication.
- Easy to find at local electronics shops.
- Typically includes RFID card and key fob.

:::warning
The RC522 can only be used with Zaparoo via a microcontroller and the [simple serial protocol](../simple-serial.md). It only supports basic RFID functionality, not full NFC like the PN532.

### Limitations vs PN532

- **Zaparoo Integration**: Requires microcontroller setup, not direct USB connection
- **Protocol Support**: ISO14443A only (no full NFC support)
- **Communication Speed**: UART limited to 9600 baud vs PN532's 115k+ baud

### Where To Buy

The RC522 is extremely common in the hobby electronics space and very easy to find locally. Search for "RC522 RFID module" at:
- Local electronics stores and hobby shops
- Amazon, eBay, AliExpress
- Arduino/Raspberry Pi suppliers

:::tip
For direct USB connection and full NFC functionality, we recommend the [PN532](./pn532-usb.md) instead.
